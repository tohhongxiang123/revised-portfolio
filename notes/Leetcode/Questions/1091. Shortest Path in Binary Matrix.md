# 1091. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-binary-matrix/

Given an `n` x `n` binary matrix `grid`, return the length of the shortest clear path in the matrix. If there is no clear path, return `-1`.

A clear path in a binary matrix is a path from the top-left cell (i.e., `(0, 0)`) to the bottom-right cell (i.e., `(n - 1, n - 1)`) such that:

-   All the visited cells of the path are `0`.
-   All the adjacent cells of the path are 8-directionally connected (i.e., they are different and they share an edge or a corner).
-   The length of a clear path is the number of visited cells of this path.

# Solution

Using BFS:

```python
neighbors = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1)]

class Solution:
    def shortestPathBinaryMatrix(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if grid[0][0] == 1:
            return -1

        visited = set()
        queue = [(0, 0, 1)]
        while len(queue) > 0:
            current_position = queue.pop(0)
            current_x, current_y = current_position[0], current_position[1]

            # we have reached the end
            if current_x == len(grid) - 1 and current_y == len(grid[0]) - 1:
                return current_position[2]

            # skip already visited nodes
            if (current_x, current_y) in visited:
                continue

            visited.add((current_x, current_y))

            # process neighbors
            for x_offset, y_offset in neighbors:
                next_position = (current_position[0] + x_offset, current_position[1] + y_offset, current_position[2] + 1)
                next_x, next_y = next_position[0], next_position[1]
                if next_x < 0 or next_x > len(grid)-1 or next_y < 0 or next_y > len(grid[0])-1: # dont proceed if out of bounds
                    continue

                if grid[next_x][next_y] == 1: # dont proceed to a wall
                    continue

                if (next_x, next_y) in visited: # dont visit already visited nodes
                    continue

                queue.append(next_position)

        return -1
```

Using A\* Search:

```python
neighbors = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1)]

def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return max(abs(x1 - x2), abs(y1 - y2))

def generate_path(parents, start, end):
    result = []

    current_node = end
    while current_node != start:
        result.append(current_node)
        current_node = parents[current_node]

    result.append(start)
    return result

class Solution:
    def shortestPathBinaryMatrix(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if grid[0][0] == 1:
            return -1

        target_x, target_y = len(grid) - 1, len(grid[0]) - 1
        queue = [] # priority queue
        parents = { (0, 0): None }
        visited = set()
        distances_from_start = {(0, 0): 0}
        heapq.heapify(queue)
        heapq.heappush(queue, (1, (0, 0)))

        while len(queue) > 0:
            _, current_coordinates = heapq.heappop(queue)
            current_x, current_y = current_coordinates

            if (current_x, current_y) in visited: # skip if already visited
                continue

            if current_x == target_x and current_y == target_y: # we have reached the target
                return len(generate_path(parents, (0, 0), (target_x, target_y)))

            visited.add((current_x, current_y))

            for offset_x, offset_y in neighbors:
                new_x, new_y = current_x + offset_x, current_y + offset_y
                # skip if out of bounds
                if new_x < 0 or new_x > len(grid) - 1 or new_y < 0 or new_y > len(grid[0]) - 1:
                    continue

                # skip if wall
                if grid[new_x][new_y] == 1:
                    continue

                # get new distance
                new_distance = 1 + distances_from_start[(current_x, current_y)]
                heuristic = distance(new_x, new_y, target_x, target_y)
                heapq.heappush(queue, (new_distance + heuristic, (new_x, new_y)))

                # if new distance is smaller than old distance
                if (new_x, new_y) not in distances_from_start or new_distance < distances_from_start[(new_x, new_y)]:
                    distances_from_start[(new_x, new_y)] = new_distance
                    parents[(new_x, new_y)] = (current_x, current_y)

        return -1
```

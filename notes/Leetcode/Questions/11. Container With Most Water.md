# 11. Container With Most Water

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

You are given an integer array height of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i`th line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        maxArea = 0
        left = 0
        right = len(height) - 1

        while left != right:
            area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)

            if area > maxArea:
                maxArea = area

            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1

        return maxArea
```

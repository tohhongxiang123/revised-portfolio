# 112. Path Sum

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.

A leaf is a node with no children.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def hasPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> bool:
        if root is None:
            return False

        # end with the leaf (no children)
        if root.left is None and root.right is None and root.val == targetSum:
            return True

        return self.hasPathSum(root.left, targetSum - root.val) or self.hasPathSum(root.right, targetSum - root.val)
```

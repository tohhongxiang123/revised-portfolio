# 1129. Shortest Path with Alternating Colors

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-with-alternating-colors/description/

You are given an integer `n`, the number of nodes in a directed graph where the nodes are labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. Each edge is red or blue in this graph, and there could be self-edges and parallel edges.

You are given two arrays `redEdges` and `blueEdges` where:

`redEdges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is a directed red edge from node `ai` to node `bi` in the graph, and
`blueEdges[j] = [uj, vj]` indicates that there is a directed blue edge from node `uj` to node `vj` in the graph.
Return an array answer of length `n`, where each `answer[x]` is the length of the shortest path from node `0` to node `x` such that the edge colors alternate along the path, or `-1` if such a path does not exist.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestAlternatingPaths(self, n: int, redEdges: List[List[int]], blueEdges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        adjListRed = collections.defaultdict(set)
        adjListBlue = collections.defaultdict(set)

        for a, b in redEdges:
            adjListRed[a].add(b)
        for a, b in blueEdges:
            adjListBlue[a].add(b)

        result = [-1] * n
        queue = [] # List<(nodeIndex, isRed, distance)>
        visited = set() # set<(nodeIndex, isRed)>

        queue.append((0, True, 0)) # go to 0 from a red branch
        queue.append((0, False, 0)) # go to 0 from a blue branch

        while len(queue) > 0:
            currentNode, isRed, currentDistance = queue.pop(0)

            if (currentNode, isRed) in visited:
                continue
            visited.add((currentNode, isRed))

            # update distance immediately when reached, and have not updated already
            if result[currentNode] < 0:
                result[currentNode] = currentDistance

            # only consider neighbors with opposite colors
            if isRed:
                for neighbor in adjListBlue[currentNode]:
                    queue.append((neighbor, not isRed, currentDistance + 1))
            else:
                for neighbor in adjListRed[currentNode]:
                    queue.append((neighbor, not isRed, currentDistance + 1))

        return result
```

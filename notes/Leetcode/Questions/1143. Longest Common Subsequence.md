# 1143. Longest Common Subsequence

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/description/

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return `0`.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

-   For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".

A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        dp = []
        for i in range(len(text1) + 1):
            dp.append([0] * (len(text2) + 1))


        for i in range(1, len(dp)):
            for j in range(1, len(dp[i])):
                letter1 = text1[i - 1]
                letter2 = text2[j - 1]

                if letter1 == letter2:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

        return dp[-1][-1]
```

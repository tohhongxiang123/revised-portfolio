# 1155. Number of Dice Rolls With Target Sum

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-dice-rolls-with-target-sum/

You have n dice and each die has k faces numbered from 1 to k.

Given three integers n, k, and target, return the number of possible ways (out of the kn total ways) to roll the dice so the sum of the face-up numbers equals target. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:

```
Input: n = 1, k = 6, target = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: You throw one die with 6 faces.
There is only one way to get a sum of 3.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = 2, k = 6, target = 7
Output: 6
Explanation: You throw two dice, each with 6 faces.
There are 6 ways to get a sum of 7: 1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: n = 30, k = 30, target = 500
Output: 222616187
Explanation: The answer must be returned modulo 109 + 7.
```

Constraints:

```
1 <= n, k <= 30
1 <= target <= 1000
```

# Solution

Note that the solution can be expressed as the following recurrence equation:

$$
f(n, k, t) = \sum_{i = 1}^{k} f(n - 1, k, t - i) \\
f(0, k, 0) = 1 \\
f(0, k, t) = 0, t != 0
$$

We will use a dictionary to store results of our previous computations to prevent overheads from recalculating

1. Check the dictionary if we already calculated the result. If the result has already been calculated previously, return the value directly from the dictionary
2. Check the base cases. If `n == 0` and `target != 0`, return 0. If `n == 0` and `target == 0`, return 1
3. Calculate the result based on the recurrence relation stated above
4. Store the result into the dictionary
5. Return the result

```python
class Solution:
    def numRollsToTarget(self, n: int, k: int, target: int) -> int:
        results = {} # store previous results to reduce recalculation

        def calculate(n: int, target: int) -> int:
            if (n, target) in results:
                return results[(n, target)]

            if n == 0 and target == 0:
                return 1

            if n == 0 and target != 0:
                return 0

            total = 0
            for i in range(1, k + 1):
                total += calculate(n - 1, target - i)

            total = total % (10**9 + 7)
            results[(n, target)] = total
            return total

        return calculate(n, target)
```

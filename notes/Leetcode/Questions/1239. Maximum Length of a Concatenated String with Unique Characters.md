# 1239. Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-a-concatenated-string-with-unique-characters/

You are given an array of strings `arr`. A string `s` is formed by the concatenation of a subsequence of `arr` that has unique characters.

Return the maximum possible length of `s`.

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

# Solution

Solutions are in $O(2^n)$

Using DFS (recurrence):

```python
def unique_characters(str1: str, str2: str) -> bool:
    return len(set(str1 + str2)) == len(str1) + len(str2)

class Solution:
    def maxLength(self, arr: List[str]) -> int:
        def solve(current: str, arr: List[str]) -> int:
            max_length = len(current)

            if len(arr) == 0:
                return max_length

            for i in range(len(arr)):
                if unique_characters(current, arr[i]):
                    current_max_length = solve(current + arr[i], arr[i + 1:])

                    max_length = max(current_max_length, max_length)

            return max_length

        arr = [word for word in arr if len(set(word)) == len(word)]
        return solve("", arr)
```

Using loops:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxLength(self, arr: List[str]) -> int:
        words = [""]

        for word in arr:
            if len(set(word)) != len(word):
                continue

            for concatenated_string in words:
                if len(set(word + concatenated_string)) != len(word) + len(concatenated_string):
                    continue

                words.append(word + concatenated_string)

        return max([len(word) for word in words])
```

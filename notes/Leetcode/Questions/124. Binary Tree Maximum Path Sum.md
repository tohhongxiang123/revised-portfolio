# 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/

A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        max_path = float("-inf")

        def get_max_gain(node):
            nonlocal max_path
            if node is None:
                return 0

            gain_on_left = max(get_max_gain(node.left), 0)
            gain_on_right = max(get_max_gain(node.right), 0)

            current_max_path = node.val + gain_on_left + gain_on_right
            max_path = max(max_path, current_max_path)

            return node.val + max(gain_on_left, gain_on_right)


        get_max_gain(root)
        return max_path
```

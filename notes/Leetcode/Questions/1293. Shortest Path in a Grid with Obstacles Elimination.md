# 1293. Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination

You are given an `m` x `n` integer matrix grid where each cell is either `0` (empty) or `1` (obstacle). You can move up, down, left, or right from and to an empty cell in one step.

Return the minimum number of steps to walk from the upper left corner `(0, 0)` to the lower right corner `(m - 1, n - 1)` given that you can eliminate at most `k` obstacles. If it is not possible to find such walk return `-1`.

# Solution

Like [1091. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-binary-matrix/), except we add 1 more dimension to keep track of the `remaining_number_of_eliminations`. The solutions run in $O(mnk)$, where the matrix is $m \times n$ and $k$ is the number of obstacle eliminations.

Using BFS:

```python
neighbors = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]

def generate_path_from(start, end, parents):
    result = []
    current_node = end

    while current_node != start:
        result.append(current_node)
        current_node = parents[current_node]

    result.append(start)
    return result[::-1]

class Solution:
    def shortestPath(self, grid: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        target_x, target_y = len(grid) - 1, len(grid[0]) - 1
        queue = [] # priority queue
        visited = set() # set of visited nodes (x, y, k)

        parents = {(0, 0, k): None} # to keep track of the path
        distances = {(0, 0, k): 0}

        if grid[0][0] == 1:
            queue.append((0, 0, k - 1))
        else:
            queue.append((0, 0, k))

        while len(queue) > 0:
            current_node = queue.pop(0)
            current_x, current_y, remaining_eliminations = current_node

            if current_node in visited:
                continue

            if current_x == target_x and current_y == target_y:
                path = generate_path_from((0, 0, k), (current_x, current_y, remaining_eliminations), parents)
                return len(path) - 1

            visited.add(current_node)

            for offset_x, offset_y in neighbors:
                new_x, new_y = current_x + offset_x, current_y + offset_y
                if new_x < 0 or new_x > len(grid) - 1 or new_y < 0 or new_y > len(grid[0]) - 1: # out of bounds check
                    continue

                new_remaining_eliminations = remaining_eliminations
                if grid[new_x][new_y] == 1: # break if it is an obstacle
                    new_remaining_eliminations -= 1

                if new_remaining_eliminations < 0: # not enough eliminations to break obstacle
                    continue

                new_node = (new_x, new_y, new_remaining_eliminations)
                if new_node in visited: # already evaluated
                    continue

                new_distance = 1 + distances[current_node]
                queue.append(new_node)

                # evaluated neighbor for first time, or found shorter distance to neighbor
                if new_node not in distances or new_distance < distances[new_node]:
                    distances[new_node] = new_distance
                    parents[new_node] = current_node

        return -1
```

Using A\* search:

```python
neighbors = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]

def heuristic(current_node, target_node):
    x1, y1, _ = current_node
    x2, y2, _ = target_node

    return max(abs(x1 - x2), abs(y1 - y2))

def generate_path_from(start, end, parents):
    result = []
    current_node = end

    while current_node != start:
        result.append(current_node)
        current_node = parents[current_node]

    result.append(start)
    return result[::-1]

        heapq.heapify(queue)

        distances = {(0, 0, k): 0}

        if grid[0][0] == 1:
            heapq.heappush(queue, (0, (0, 0, k - 1)))
        else:
            heapq.heappush(queue, (0, (0, 0, k)))

        while len(queue) > 0:
            _, current_node = heapq.heappop(queue)
            current_x, current_y, remaining_eliminations = current_node

                return len(path) - 1

            visited.add(current_node)

            for offset_x, offset_y in neighbors:
                new_x, new_y = current_x + offset_x, current_y + offset_y

                if new_remaining_eliminations < 0: # not enough eliminations to break obstacle

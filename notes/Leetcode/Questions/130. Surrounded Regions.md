# 130. Surrounded Regions

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/

Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

# Solution

1. Iterate through the boundary of the board
2. For each O on the boundary on the board, we mark it as "do not flip". Then we DFS on the O, and continue marking all connected O's as "do not flip"
3. Once done, we flip all those that were marked to flip, and keep those that "do not flip"

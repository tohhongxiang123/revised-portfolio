# 1328. Break a Palindrome

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/break-a-palindrome/

Given a palindromic string of lowercase English letters `palindrome`, replace **exactly one** character with any lowercase English letter so that the resulting string is not a palindrome and that it is the **lexicographically smallest** one possible.

Return the resulting string. If there is no way to replace a character to make it not a palindrome, return an empty string.

A string `a` is lexicographically smaller than a string `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, `a` has a character strictly smaller than the corresponding character in `b`. For example, "abcc" is lexicographically smaller than "abcd" because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and 'c' is smaller than 'd'.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def breakPalindrome(self, palindrome: string) -> string:
        # replace the first instance of not a with an a
        for i in range(len(palindrome) // 2):
            if palindrome[i] != "a":
                return palindrome[:i] + "a" + palindrome[i+1:]

        # all the characters is a b, replace the last character with a b
        return palindrome[:-1] + "b" if n > 1 else palindrome
```

# 1335. Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difficulty-of-a-job-schedule/

You want to schedule a list of jobs in `d` days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the `i`th job, you have to finish all the jobs `j` where `0 <= j < i`).

You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the `d` days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day.

You are given an integer array `jobDifficulty` and an integer `d`. The difficulty of the `i`th job is `jobDifficulty[i]`.

Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return `-1`.

# Solution

First, we should know if there are more jobs than days, we will always have a free day, and that breaks the condition of finishing at least 1 task every day. We will return `-1` if that is the case.

We will create an array `results[d][len(jobDifficulty)]`. `results[day][job]` represents the minimum difficulty of doing jobs from index `0` to `job` in `day` days. We will update the job difficulty by doing the following:

```
results[day][job] = min(results[day - 1][i] + max(jobDifficulty[i + 1:])), day - 1 <= i < len(jobDifficulty)
```

We do all jobs from `0` to `i` in `day - 1` days, and then do the remaining jobs (index `i + 1` to `len(jobDifficulty) - 1`) on the last day. We find the combination that minimises the job difficulty, and use that result

```python
class Solution:
    def minDifficulty(self, jobDifficulty: List[int], d: int) -> int:
        if len(jobDifficulty) < d: # will have free day
            return -1

        results = []
        for i in range(d):
            results.append([0] * len(jobDifficulty))

        # base case
        # on day 0, we have to do all the jobs
        results[0][0] = jobDifficulty[0]
        for i in range(1, len(jobDifficulty)):
            results[0][i] = max(results[0][i - 1], jobDifficulty[i])

        for day in range(1, d):
            for job in range(day, len(jobDifficulty)): # computing the minimum difficulty for doing all jobs up to `job` on day `day`
                results[day][job] = math.inf # start with infinity

                # We start with doing only job `job` on day `day`
                # We calculate the difficulty by checking results[day - 1][job - 1] (the total difficulty of doing all jobs from `0` to `job-1`) and adding our current day job dificulty
                # If this reduces the overall job schedule difficulty, we set it as a new minimum
                # Then we will do jobs from `job - 1` to `job`, and repeat the calculation
                # So we do jobs `0` to `i - 1` for `day - 1` days, and we do jobs `i` to `job` on the last day
                # We repeat until we do from job index `day` to `job` on the last day (because we need to do at least 1 task a day, we do jobs `0` to `day - 1` in `day - 1` days, and then jobs `day` to `job` on the last day)
                currentDayDifficulty = jobDifficulty[job]
                for i in range(job, day - 1, -1):
                    currentDayDifficulty = max(currentDayDifficulty, jobDifficulty[i])
                    results[day][job] = min(results[day][job], results[day - 1][i - 1] + currentDayDifficulty)


        return results[-1][-1]
```

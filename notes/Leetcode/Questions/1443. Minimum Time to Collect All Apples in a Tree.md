# 1443. Minimum Time to Collect All Apples in a Tree

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-collect-all-apples-in-a-tree/

Given an undirected tree consisting of `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n-1`, which has some apples in their vertices. You spend 1 second to walk over one edge of the tree. Return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend to collect all apples in the tree, starting at vertex `0` and coming back to this vertex.

The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` means that exists an edge connecting the vertices `ai` and `bi`. Additionally, there is a boolean array `hasApple`, where `hasApple[i] = true` means that vertex `i` has an apple; otherwise, it does not have any apple.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def minTime(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], hasApple: List[bool]) -> int:
        # create a map for all the neighbors of every vertex
        children = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for vertex1, vertex2 in edges:
            children[vertex1].append(vertex2)
            children[vertex2].append(vertex1)

        def dfs(root: int, parent: int) -> int:
            if root is None: # base case
                return 0

            # prevents backtracking up the tree
            timeTaken = sum(dfs(n, root) for n in children[root] if n != parent)
            if timeTaken == 0 and not hasApple[root]: # if the whole subtree has no apple, dont walk here
                return 0

            return 2 + timeTaken # time taken to walk to this edge + collect all subtree apples

        # subtract 2 since we do not need to walk to the starting edge
        # however, if there are no apples to collect, we should not return a negative start time
        minimumTimeToCollectApples = max(0, dfs(0, -1) - 2)
        return minimumTimeToCollectApples
```

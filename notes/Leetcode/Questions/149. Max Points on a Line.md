# 149. Max Points on a Line

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/max-points-on-a-line/description/

Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the X-Y plane, return the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.

# Solution

$O(n^2)$

```python
class Solution:
    def maxPoints(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        maxPoints = 1

        for i in range(1, len(points)):
            frequency = defaultdict(int)
            samePoints = 1

            for j in range(i):
                if (points[i][1] == points[j][1]) and (points[i][0] == points[j][0]):
                    samePoints += 1
                elif points[i][0] == points[j][0]:
                    frequency[math.inf] += 1
                else:
                    slope = (points[i][1] - points[j][1]) / (points[i][0] - points[j][0])
                    frequency[slope] += 1

            maxPoints = max(maxPoints, max(frequency.values()) + samePoints)

        return maxPoints
```

# 1519. Number of Nodes in the Sub-Tree With the Same Label

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-nodes-in-the-sub-tree-with-the-same-label/description/

You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and exactly `n - 1` edges. The root of the tree is the node `0`, and each node of the tree has a label which is a lower-case character given in the string labels (i.e. The node with the number `i` has the label `labels[i]`).

The edges array is given on the form `edges[i] = [ai, bi]`, which means there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree.

Return an array of size `n` where `ans[i]` is the number of nodes in the subtree of the `ith` node which have the same label as node `i`.

A subtree of a tree `T` is the tree consisting of a node in `T` and all of its descendant nodes.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def countSubTrees(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], labels: str) -> List[int]:
        # create nodemap
        children = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for vertex1, vertex2 in edges:
            children[vertex1].append(vertex2)
            children[vertex2].append(vertex1)

        result = [0] * n
        def dfs(root: int, parent: int) -> collections.Counter:
            count = collections.Counter() # counter for all the frequency of labels in this subtree
            if root is None:
                return count

            count[labels[root]] += 1 # add to current label's count
            for neighbor in children[root]:
                if neighbor != parent: # dfs through all neighbors, without going back up to the parent
                    count += dfs(neighbor, root)

            result[root] = count[labels[root]] # update result
            return count

        dfs(0, -1) # start from root of the tree
        return result
```

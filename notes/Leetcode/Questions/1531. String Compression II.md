# 1531. String Compression II

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression-ii/

Run-length encoding is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string "aabccc" we replace "aa" by "a2" and replace "ccc" by "c3". Thus the compressed string becomes "a2bc3".

Notice that in this problem, we are not adding '1' after single characters.

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You need to delete at most `k` characters from `s` such that the run-length encoded version of `s` has minimum length.

Find the minimum length of the run-length encoded version of `s` after deleting at most `k` characters.

Constraints:

-   `1 <= s.length <= 100`
-   `0 <= k <= s.length`
-   `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

# Solution

For any string `s`, we aim to reduce the number of unique characters as much as possible. Hence, we will keep the character with the highest frequency, and remove as many of the other characters as possible.

We will define a function `compress(i, k)`, where `i` is the index in `s` we are starting from, and `k` is the number of deletes we have remaining. We know, for the base case:

-   If `i == len(s)`, we have gone past the end of the string. Hence, the run-length is 0
-   If `len(s) - i <= k`, we can delete all the letters in the string. Hence, the run-length is 0
-   If `k < 0`, we cannot delete anymore. We should not reach this stage, so we return `math.inf`

We now have to define the recursion:

```
compress(i, k) = min(get_run_length(max_freq) + compress(j + 1, k - (j - i + 1 - max_freq)) for j in range(len(s)))
```

-   `max_freq` is the maximum frequency of any letter in the string `s[i:j]`
-   `get_run_length(max_freq)` is the run length after deleting the other letters. It is when we keep the letter with the `max_freq`
-   Since we are keeping the letter with the maximum frequency, the number of deletes for a string `s[i:j]` is: `j - i + 1 - max_freq`
    -   `j - i + 1` is the number of letters in `s[i:j]`
    -   Since we are keeping the letter with `max_freq`, then number of deletes is `j - i + 1 - max_freq`
    -   We are left with `k - (j - i + 1 - max_freq)` deletes

Finally, we want to return the result of `compress(0, k)`

```python
class Solution:
    def getLengthOfOptimalCompression(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        memo = {}

        def get_length(max_frequency):
            if max_frequency == 1: # a
                return 1
            if max_frequency < 10: # a2, a9
                return 2
            if max_frequency < 100: # a10, a99
                return 3
            return 4 # Dont need anymore since 1 <= s.length <= 100

        def compression(start_index, number_of_deletes): # minimum run length to encode s[i:] with at most number_of_deletes deletions
            if (start_index, number_of_deletes) in memo: # answer already computed
                return memo[(start_index, number_of_deletes)]

            if number_of_deletes < 0: # no more left to delete
                return math.inf

            if start_index == len(s): # reach the end of the string
                return 0

            if len(s) - start_index <= number_of_deletes: # Remaining length of the string is shorter than number of deletes
                return 0

            result = math.inf
            max_frequency = 0 # max frequency letter in s[i..j]
            count = defaultdict(int) # keeps track of the frequency of each letter that appeared

            # we keep the character with the max frequency and remove all other characters
            for j in range(start_index, len(s)):
                count[s[j]] += 1 # Keep track of the frequency of letters
                max_frequency = max(max_frequency, count[s[j]]) # Keep track of the letter with the maximum frequency

                # number of letters we passed = (j - start_index + 1)
                # number of deletes in this round is j - start_index + 1 - max_frequency
                # number of deletes remaining is number_of_deletes - (j - start_index + 1 - max_frequency)
                result = min(result, get_length(max_frequency) + compression(j + 1, number_of_deletes - (j - start_index + 1 - max_frequency)))

            memo[(start_index, number_of_deletes)] = result
            return result

        result = compression(0, k)
        return result
```

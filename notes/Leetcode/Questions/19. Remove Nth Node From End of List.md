# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/

Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `n`th node from the end of the list and return its head.

# Solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # ahead pointer will be n away from behind pointer
        # when ahead reaches the end of the list (ahead_pointer is None)
        # behind_pointer will be the nth last node
        ahead_pointer = head
        behind_pointer_previous = None # behind_pointer_previous keeps track of the node that is just before behind_pointer
        behind_pointer = head

        for i in range(n):
            ahead_pointer = ahead_pointer.next

        # move ahead_pointer to nth last node
        while ahead_pointer is not None:
            ahead_pointer = ahead_pointer.next
            behind_pointer_previous = behind_pointer
            behind_pointer = behind_pointer.next

        if behind_pointer_previous is None: # removing the head of the list
            head = head.next
        else:
            behind_pointer_previous.next = behind_pointer.next

        return head
```

# 1926. Nearest Exit from Entrance in Maze

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/nearest-exit-from-entrance-in-maze/description/

You are given an `m x n` matrix maze (0-indexed) with empty cells (represented as '.') and walls (represented as '+'). You are also given the `entrance` of the maze, where `entrance = [entrancerow, entrancecol]` denotes the row and column of the cell you are initially standing at.

In one step, you can move one cell up, down, left, or right. You cannot step into a cell with a wall, and you cannot step outside the maze. Your goal is to find the nearest `exit` from the `entrance`. An `exit` is defined as an empty cell that is at the border of the maze. The `entrance` does not count as an `exit`.

Return the number of steps in the shortest path from the entrance to the nearest exit, or `-1` if no such path exists.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def isExit(self, cell: List[int], x: int, y: int):
        return cell[0] == 0 or cell[1] == 0 or cell[0] == x - 1 or cell[1] == y - 1

    def nearestExit(self, maze: List[List[str]], entrance: List[int]) -> int:
        queue = []

        current_cell = (entrance[0], entrance[1], 0)
        visited = set()
        queue.append(current_cell)

        while len(queue) > 0:
            current_cell_x, current_cell_y, distance = queue.pop(0)
            current_cell = (current_cell_x, current_cell_y)

            if self.isExit(current_cell, len(maze), len(maze[0])) and current_cell != tuple(entrance):
                return distance

            offsets = [(0, -1), (0, 1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
            neighbors = [(current_cell[0] + offset[0], current_cell[1] + offset[1]) for offset in offsets]

            for neighbor in neighbors:
                if neighbor[0] < 0 or neighbor[0] > len(maze) - 1 or neighbor[1] < 0 or neighbor[1] > len(maze[0]) - 1:
                    continue # out of bounds

                if maze[neighbor[0]][neighbor[1]] == "+":
                    continue # wall

                if (neighbor[0], neighbor[1]) in visited:
                    continue # visited

                # mark visited here, instead of after popping from queue
                # prevents adding duplicates to the queue
                visited.add((neighbor[0], neighbor[1]))
                queue.append((neighbor[0], neighbor[1], distance + 1))

        return -1
```

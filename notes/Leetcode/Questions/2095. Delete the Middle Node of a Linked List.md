# 2095. Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-the-middle-node-of-a-linked-list/

You are given the `head` of a linked list. Delete the middle node, and return the `head` of the modified linked list.

The middle node of a linked list of size `n` is the `⌊n / 2⌋`th node from the start using 0-based indexing, where `⌊x⌋` denotes the largest integer less than or equal to `x`.

For `n` = `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5`, the middle nodes are `0`, `1`, `1`, `2`, and `2`, respectively.

# Solution

In 2 passes:

1. First pass gets the length of the linked list
2. Second pass gets the middle node of the linked list
3. Delete the middle node of the linked list

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def deleteMiddle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        length = 0

        current_node = head
        while current_node is not None:
            length += 1
            current_node = current_node.next

        middle_node_index = length // 2

        previous_node = None
        current_node  = head

        for i in range(middle_node_index):
            previous_node = current_node
            current_node = current_node.next

        # linked list has only 1 element
        if previous_node is None:
            return None

        previous_node.next = current_node.next

        return head
```

In 1 pass:

1. We have 2 pointers: `fast` and `slow`. We will make the `fast` pointer move twice as fast as `slow`. We will also have `previous`, which is the pointer right before `slow`
2. When `fast` reaches the end of the linked list, `slow` will be at the middle of the linked list, and `previous` will be the node right before the middle of the linked list. We will now delete the middle node

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def deleteMiddle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        slow = head
        fast = head
        previous = None

        while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:
            fast = fast.next.next
            previous = slow
            slow = slow.next

        if previous is None:
            return None

        previous.next = slow.next

        return head
```

# 2136. Earliest Possible Day of Full Bloom

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/earliest-possible-day-of-full-bloom/

You have `n` flower seeds. Every seed must be planted first before it can begin to grow, then bloom. Planting a seed takes time and so does the growth of a seed. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays `plantTime` and `growTime`, of length `n` each:

-   `plantTime[i]` is the number of full days it takes you to plant the `i`th seed. Every day, you can work on planting exactly one seed. You do not have to work on planting the same seed on consecutive days, but the planting of a seed is not complete until you have worked `plantTime[i]` days on planting it in total.
-   `growTime[i]` is the number of full days it takes the `i`th seed to grow after being completely planted. After the last day of its growth, the flower blooms and stays bloomed forever.
    From the beginning of day 0, you can plant the seeds in any order.

Return the earliest possible day where all seeds are blooming.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def earliestFullBloom(self, plantTime: List[int], growTime: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(growTime)
        # we want to grow the plant with the largest growTime first
        # so that we can spend its grow time planting the other plants
        indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda x: -growTime[x]) # indices of plants with longest grow time

        earliest_possible_day_of_full_bloom = 0
        plant_sum = 0

        for i in indices:
            # time to grow up to the ith plant =
            # time to grow all previous plants + time to plant current plant + time to grow current plant
            time = plant_sum + plantTime[i] + growTime[i]

            # growTime of the previous plant may be very long, and exceed `time`
            # plant_sum does not include grow time because we can plant and grow at the same time
            earliest_possible_day_of_full_bloom = max(earliest_possible_day_of_full_bloom, time)

            plant_sum += plantTime[i]

        return earliest_possible_day_of_full_bloom
```

Runs in $O(n \log n)$ time, $O(n)$ space

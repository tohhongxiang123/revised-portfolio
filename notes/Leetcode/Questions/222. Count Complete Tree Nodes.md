# 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/description/

Given the `root` of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and `2h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than $O(n)$ time complexity.

# Solution

Runs in $O((\log n)^2)$ time and $O(\log n)$ space. We use the fact that children of complete trees are also complete trees

For each node, we check if it is a complete tree by checking the left and right height. If the left right is equal to the right height, it is a complete tree, and we know the number of nodes is just $2^h - 1$.

If it is not a complete tree, we recurse and find `1 + self.countNodes(root.left) + self.countNodes(root.right)`

```python
class Solution:
    def countNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if root is None:
            return 0

        left = root
        right = root

        leftHeight = 1
        rightHeight = 1

        while left.left is not None:
            leftHeight += 1
            left = left.left

        while right.right is not None:
            rightHeight += 1
            right = right.right

        if leftHeight == rightHeight:
            return 2 ** leftHeight - 1

        return 1 + self.countNodes(root.left) + self.countNodes(root.right)
```

Another solution which runs in $O(n)$ time is the BFS search. We search through the tree using BFS. If we encounter a node without both children, it means we can see the last node already. And we can return the number of nodes = `count + len(queue) + number_of_children_of_current_node`

```python
class Solution:
    def countNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if root is None:
            return 0

        count = 0

        queue = []
        queue.append(root)

        while len(queue) > 0:
            current_node = queue.pop(0)
            count += 1

            if current_node.left is None or current_node.right is None:
                number_of_children_of_current_node = 0

                if current_node.left is not None:
                    number_of_children_of_current_node += 1
                if current_node.right is not None:
                    number_of_children_of_current_node += 1

                return count + len(queue) + number_of_children_of_current_node

            queue.append(current_node.left)
            queue.append(current_node.right)

        return count
```

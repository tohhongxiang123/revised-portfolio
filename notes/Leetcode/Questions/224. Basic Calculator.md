# 224. Basic Calculator

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator/

Given a string `s` representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        s = s.replace(" ", "")

        index = 0
        number = 0
        stack = []
        operation = "+"


        def execute(operation: str, number: int):
            if operation == "+":
                stack.append(number)
            elif operation == "-":
                stack.append(-number)

        while index < len(s):
            if s[index].isdigit():
                number = 10 * number + int(s[index])
            elif s[index] in "+-":
                execute(operation, number)
                number = 0
                operation = s[index]
            elif s[index] == "(":
                number, offset = self.calculate(s[index + 1:])
                index += offset
            elif s[index] == ")":
                execute(operation, number)
                return sum(stack), index + 1

            index += 1

        execute(operation, number)

        return sum(stack)
```

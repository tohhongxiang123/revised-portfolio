# 2246. Longest Path With Different Adjacent Characters

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-path-with-different-adjacent-characters/description/

You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) rooted at node `0` consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The tree is represented by a 0-indexed array parent of size `n`, where `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`. Since node `0` is the root, `parent[0] == -1`.

You are also given a string `s` of length `n`, where `s[i]` is the character assigned to node `i`.

Return the length of the longest path in the tree such that no pair of adjacent nodes on the path have the same character assigned to them.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPath(self, parent: List[int], s: str) -> int:
        neighbors = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for child, parent in enumerate(parent):
            neighbors[parent].append(child)

        longestPath = 1
        def dfs(root: int) -> int: # returns the longest path that starts from root
            nonlocal longestPath

            # it is possible that the longest path passes through the current node,
            # so we save the length of the 2 longest paths
            max1, max2 = 0, 0
            for neighbor in neighbors[root]:
                neighborPathLength = dfs(neighbor)

                if s[neighbor] != s[root]: # we can only pass through if labels are not the same
                    if neighborPathLength > max1:
                        max2 = max1
                        max1 = neighborPathLength
                    elif neighborPathLength > max2:
                        max2 = neighborPathLength

            longestPath = max(longestPath, max1 + 1 + max2)
            return max(max1, max2) + 1


        dfs(0)
        return longestPath
```

# 2256. Minimum Average Difference

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-average-difference/description/

You are given a `0`-indexed integer array `nums` of length `n`.

The average difference of the index `i` is the absolute difference between the average of the first `i + 1` elements of nums and the average of the last `n - i - 1` elements. Both averages should be **rounded down to the nearest integer**.

Return the **index** with the minimum average difference. If there are multiple such indices, return the **smallest** one.

Note:

-   The absolute difference of two numbers is the absolute value of their difference.
-   The average of `n` elements is the sum of the `n` elements divided (integer division) by `n`.
-   The average of `0` elements is considered to be `0`.

# Solution

Sliding window sum instead of always calculating the average from scratch

```python
class Solution:
    def calculate_average(self, current_sum: int, length: int) -> int:
        if length == 0:
            return 0

        return current_sum // length

    def minimumAverageDifference(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return 0

        sum_left = nums[0]
        sum_right = sum(nums[1:])
        minimum_average_difference = abs(self.calculate_average(sum_left, 1) - self.calculate_average(sum_right, len(nums) - 1))
        minimum_average_difference_index = 0

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            sum_left += nums[i]
            sum_right -= nums[i]

            new_average_difference = abs(self.calculate_average(sum_left, i + 1)  - self.calculate_average(sum_right, len(nums) - i - 1))
            if new_average_difference < minimum_average_difference:
                minimum_average_difference = new_average_difference
                minimum_average_difference_index = i

        return minimum_average_difference_index
```

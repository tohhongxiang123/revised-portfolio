# 2279. Maximum Bags With Full Capacity of Rocks

You have `n` bags numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given two `0`-indexed integer arrays capacity and rocks. The `ith` bag can hold a maximum of `capacity[i]` rocks and currently contains `rocks[i]` rocks. You are also given an integer `additionalRocks`, the number of additional rocks you can place in any of the bags.

Return the **maximum** number of bags that could have full capacity after placing the additional rocks in some bags.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumBags(self, capacity: List[int], rocks: List[int], additionalRocks: int) -> int:
        remaining_capacity = sorted([c - r for c, r in zip(capacity, rocks)])
        number_of_full_bags = 0

        additional_rocks_remaining = additionalRocks

        for c in remaining_capacity:
            if additional_rocks_remaining < c:
                break

            additional_rocks_remaining -= c
            number_of_full_bags += 1

        return number_of_full_bags
```

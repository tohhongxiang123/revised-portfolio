# 2359. Find Closest Node to Given Two Nodes

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/find-closest-node-to-given-two-nodes/description/

You are given a directed graph of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, where each node has at most one outgoing edge.

The graph is represented with a given 0-indexed array edges of size `n`, indicating that there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `edges[i]`. If there is no outgoing edge from `i`, then `edges[i] == -1`.

You are also given two integers `node1` and `node2`.

Return the index of the node that can be reached from both `node1` and `node2`, such that the maximum between the distance from `node1` to that node, and from `node2` to that node is minimized. If there are multiple answers, return the node with the smallest index, and if no possible answer exists, return `-1`.

Note that `edges` may contain cycles.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def updateDistances(self, currentNode, edges, distances, visited):
        visited.add(currentNode)
        neighbor = edges[currentNode]

        if neighbor != -1 and neighbor not in visited:
            distances[neighbor] = distances[currentNode] + 1
            self.updateDistances(neighbor, edges, distances, visited)


    def closestMeetingNode(self, edges: List[int], node1: int, node2: int) -> int:
        distancesFromNode1 = [0] * len(edges)
        visited1 = set()
        distancesFromNode2 = [0] * len(edges)
        visited2 = set()

        self.updateDistances(node1, edges, distancesFromNode1, visited1)
        self.updateDistances(node2, edges, distancesFromNode2, visited2)

        result = -1
        minDistance = float('inf')
        for node in range(len(edges)):
            currentMaxDistance = max(distancesFromNode1[node], distancesFromNode2[node])

            if node not in visited1 or node not in visited2:
                continue

            if currentMaxDistance < minDistance:
                result = node
                minDistance = currentMaxDistance

        return result
```

# 295. Find Median from Data Stream

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/description/

The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value, and the median is the mean of the two middle values.

-   For example, for `arr = [2,3,4]`, the median is `3`.
-   For example, for `arr = [2,3]`, the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

Implement the `MedianFinder` class:

-   `MedianFinder()` initializes the `MedianFinder` object.
-   `void addNum(int num)` adds the integer num from the data stream to the data structure.
-   `double findMedian()` returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within $10^{-5}$ of the actual answer will be accepted.

# Solution

We store the data in 2 heaps: a min-heap and the max-heap. Check [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/solutions/74047/java-python-two-heap-solution-o-log-n-add-o-1-find/)

```python
class MedianFinder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.small = [] # max heap, represented using the negative numbers
        self.large = [] # min heap

    def addNum(self, num: int) -> None:
        if len(self.small) == len(self.large):
            # push into the small array first, get the largest element, then push into large array
            heapq.heappush(self.large, -heapq.heappushpop(self.small, -num))
        else:
            # push into large array first, get the smallest element, push into small array
            heapq.heappush(self.small, -heapq.heappushpop(self.large, num))

    def findMedian(self) -> float:
        if len(self.small) == len(self.large):
            # since self.small is a max heap, the numbers are negative instead
            return (-self.small[0] + self.large[0]) / 2
        else:
            return self.large[0]


# Your MedianFinder object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MedianFinder()
# obj.addNum(num)
# param_2 = obj.findMedian()
```

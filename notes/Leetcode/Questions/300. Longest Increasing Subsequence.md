# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, `[3,6,2,7]` is a subsequence of the array `[0,3,1,6,2,2,7]`.

We use the following fact for $i > j$:

$$
L(i) = 1 + L(j) \text{ if } nums[i] > nums[j] \text{ else } L(i)
$$

1. We iterate through every number in the array (`nums[i]`)
2. For every number that comes before this specific number (`nums[j]`)
3. If `nums[i] > nums[j]`, then its an increasing subsequence, and we can update the result with `lengths[i] = max(lengths[i], 1 + lengths[j])`
4. After going through the whole array, return maximum value in `lengths`

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        lengths = [1] * len(nums)

        # [0, 2, 4, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 4]
        #     ^j       ^i
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                    lengths[i] = max(lengths[i], 1 + lengths[j])

        return max(lengths)
```

This is $O(n^2)$

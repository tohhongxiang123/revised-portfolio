# 309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/description/

You are given an array prices where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

-   After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = {}

        def dfs(i: int, buying: bool): # i: index in prices, buying: whether we are buying on the ith day
            if i >= len(prices): # reach the end of prices
                return 0

            if (i, buying) in dp: # already cached
                return dp[(i, buying)]

            cooldown = dfs(i + 1, buying) # overall profit if cooldown
            if buying:
                buy = dfs(i + 1, not buying) - prices[i] # overall profit after buying
                dp[(i, buying)] = max(buy, cooldown)
            else:
                sell = dfs(i + 2, not buying) + prices[i] # overall profit after selling. Note that cooldown must occur after selling
                dp[(i, buying)] = max(sell, cooldown)

            return dp[(i, buying)]

        return dfs(0, True) # always buy on first day

```

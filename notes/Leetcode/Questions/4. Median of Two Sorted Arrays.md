1. We will let `a` be the shorter array, and `b` be the longer array. We will perform binary search on the smaller array
2. We initialise `left_pointer` to be at the start of `a`, and `right_pointer` to be the end of `a`
3. We initialise a "guess" for the left partition for the merged arrays by marking out a portion of `a` and `b`

    We assume that `len(a) / 2` of array `a` are in the left partition. We initialise a pointer within `a` (`(left_pointer + right_pointer) // 2`) which marks the left and right partitions of `a`.

    The number of remaining elements that should belong in the left partition is `total_length / 2 - len(a) / 2`. The index of the pointer in `b` would be `total_length / 2 - middle_a - 2`

4. Now we want to check if both partitions in `a` and `b` are correct.

    ```
    total_length = 7 + 4 = 11
    half_total_length = 11 / 2 = 5

    middle_a = (left + right) / 2 = 1
    middle_b = half_total_length - middle_a - 2 = 2
    ==

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7
        ^middle_b

    1 2 3 4
      ^middle_a
    ```

    We now define

    - `left_a` being the largest element of the left partition of `a`
    - `right_a` being the smallest element of the right partition of `a`
    - `left_b` being the largest element of the left partition of `b`
    - `right_b` being the smallest element of the right partition of `b`

    If `left_a <= right_b` and `left_b <= right_a`, it is correctly partitioned, and we can just return the median

    If `left_a > right_b`, this means there are too many elements in `a`, and we reduce our search space in `a` by decreasing the right pointer to `middle_a - 1`

    If `left_b > right_a`, this means there are too little elements in `a`, and we move the left pointer up to `middle_a + 1`

```python
class Solution:
    def findMedianSortedArrays(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> float:
        []

        a, b = nums1, nums2
        total_length = len(a) + len(b)
        half_total_length = total_length // 2 # floored for finding median position

        if len(a) > len(b):
            b, a = a, b

        # initialise pointers for binary search
        left_pointer = 0
        right_pointer = len(a) - 1
        while True:
            middle_a = (left_pointer + right_pointer) // 2 # index of middle element in a
            middle_b = half_total_length - middle_a - 2 # index of middle element in b

            left_a = a[middle_a] if middle_a >= 0 else float("-infinity")
            right_a = a[middle_a + 1] if (middle_a + 1) < len(a) else float("infinity")

            left_b = b[middle_b] if middle_b >= 0 else float("-infinity")
            right_b = b[middle_b + 1] if (middle_b + 1) < len(b) else float("infinity")

            if left_a <= right_b and left_b <= right_a:
                if total_length % 2 == 0:
                    return (min(right_a, right_b) + max(left_a, left_b)) / 2
                else:
                    return min(right_a, right_b)
            elif left_a > right_b:
                right_pointer = middle_a - 1 # too many elements in A
            else:
                left_pointer = middle_a + 1
```

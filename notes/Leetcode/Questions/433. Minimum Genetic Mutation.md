# 433. Minimum Genetic Mutation

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-genetic-mutation/

A gene string can be represented by an 8-character long string, with choices from 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

Suppose we need to investigate a mutation from a gene string `start` to a gene string `end` where one mutation is defined as one single character changed in the gene string.

-   For example, "AACCGGTT" --> "AACCGGTA" is one mutation.

There is also a gene bank bank that records all the valid gene mutations. A gene must be in bank to make it a valid gene string.

Given the two gene strings `start` and `end` and the gene bank `bank`, return the minimum number of mutations needed to mutate from `start` to `end`. If there is no such a mutation, return `-1`.

Note that the starting point is assumed to be valid, so it might not be included in the bank.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def minMutation(self, start: str, end: str, bank: List[str]) -> int:
        availableMutations = set(bank)

        currentMutation = start

        queue = []
        queue.append((currentMutation, 0))

        while len(queue) > 0:
            currentMutation, step = queue.pop(0)
            if currentMutation == end:
                return step

            for i in range(len(start)):
                for letter in ["A", "C", "G", "T"]:
                    potentialMutation = currentMutation[:i] + letter + currentMutation[i + 1:]

                    if potentialMutation in availableMutations:
                        availableMutations.remove(potentialMutation)
                        queue.append((potentialMutation, step + 1))

        return -1
```

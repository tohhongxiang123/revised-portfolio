# 443. String Compression

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/

Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in `chars`:

-   If the group's length is `1`, append the character to `s`.
-   Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string `s` should not be returned separately, but instead, be stored in the input character array `chars`. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.

After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the array.

You must write an algorithm that uses only **constant extra space**.

```python
class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: List[str]) -> int:
        index = 0 # which part of the array we are modifying
        i = 0 # start of group with same characters
        j = i # end of group with same characters

        while i < len(chars):
            while j < len(chars) and chars[i] == chars[j]: # find the group with same characters
                j += 1

            chars[index] = chars[i] # write the letter of the group
            index += 1

            if j - i > 1: # write the count if > 1
                count = str(j - i)

                for character in count:
                    chars[index] = character
                    index += 1

            i = j # go to next group

        return index
```

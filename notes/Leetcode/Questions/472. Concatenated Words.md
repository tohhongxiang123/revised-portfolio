# 472. Concatenated Words

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenated-words/

Given an array of strings `words` (without duplicates), return all the concatenated words in the given list of words.

A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words in the given array.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        d = set(words) # searching within d becomes O(1)

        def dfs(word):
            for i in range(1, len(word)):
                prefix = word[:i]
                suffix = word[i:]

                if prefix in d and suffix in d:
                    return True
                if prefix in d and dfs(suffix):
                    return True
                if suffix in d and dfs(prefix):
                    return True

            return False

        res = []
        for word in words:
            if dfs(word):
                res.append(word)

        return res
```

# 491. Non-decreasing Subsequences

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/non-decreasing-subsequences/description/

Given an integer array `nums`, return all the different possible non-decreasing subsequences of the given array with at least two elements. You may return the answer in any order.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findSubsequences(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        subsequences = set()

        for num in nums:
            currentSubsequences = {(num,)}

            for subsequence in subsequences:
                if len(subsequence) == 0 or subsequence[-1] <= num:
                    currentSubsequences |= {subsequence + (num,)}

            subsequences |= currentSubsequences

        return [s for s in subsequences if len(s) >= 2]

```

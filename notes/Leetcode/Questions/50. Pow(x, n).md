# 50. Pow(x, n)

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/

Implement `pow(x, n)`, which calculates `x` raised to the power `n` (i.e., $x^n$).

# Solution

Just multiplying by $n$ times will not work, as that is $O(n)$, and we can do better. We will use binary exponentiation

For example, let $n = 9 = (1001)_2$. So we can express $x^9 = x^{2^3} x^{2^1}$

An $O(\log n)$ solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def myPow(self, x: float, n: int) -> float:
        a = x
        result = 1
        is_negative = n < 0
        n = abs(n)

        while n > 0:
            if n % 2 != 0:
                result *= a

            a *= a
            n = n // 2

        if is_negative:
            return 1 / result

        return result
```

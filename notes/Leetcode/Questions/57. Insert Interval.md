# 57. Insert Interval

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/description/

You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represent the start and the end of the `ith` interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `starti`. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by `starti` and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return `intervals` after the insertion.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def insert(self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # left are the intervals that occur before newInterval
        # right are the intervals that occur after newInterval
        # merge are intervals to be merged with newInterval
        left, merge, right = [], [], []

        for interval in intervals:
            if interval[1] < newInterval[0]: # end of interval must be less that start of new interval
                left.append(interval)
            elif interval[0] > newInterval[1]: # start of interval must be more than end of new interval
                right.append(interval)
            else: # new interval overlaps with existing intervals
                merge.append(interval)

        # if we need to merge intervals, we do so
        # if not, we just append the new interval
        if len(merge) > 0:
            mergedStart = min(newInterval[0], merge[0][0])
            mergedEnd = max(newInterval[1], merge[-1][1])
        else:
            mergedStart, mergedEnd = newInterval

        return left + [[mergedStart, mergedEnd]] + right
```

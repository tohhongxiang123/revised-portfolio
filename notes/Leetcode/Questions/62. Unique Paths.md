# 62. Unique Paths

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/

There is a robot on an `m` x `n` grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to $2 * 10^9$.

# Solution

By dynamic programming:

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        results = []
        for i in range(m):
            results.append([0] * n)
        results[0][0] = 1 # origin of robot

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if i > 0:
                    results[i][j] += results[i - 1][j] # robot comes in from the top
                if j > 0:
                    results[i][j] += results[i][j - 1] # robot comes in from the left

        return results[m - 1][n - 1]
```

By using combinatorial math:

We know that for an $m \times n$ matrix, the robot needs to move down $m - 1$ times and move right $n - 1$ times. Hence, the number of unique ways to reach the bottom right corner is the same as the number of permutations for $m-1$ "D"s and $n-1$ "R"s. This is given as

$$
T = \frac{(m + n - 2)!}{(m - 1)!(n - 1)!}
$$

```python
class Solution:
    def factorial(m: int) -> int:
        result = 1
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            result *= m

        return result

    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        return int(factorial(m + n - 2) / factorial(m - 1) / factorial(n - 1))
```

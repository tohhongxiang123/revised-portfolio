# 692. Top K Frequent Words

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-words/

Given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent strings.

Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, words: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:
        frequencies = {} # { [word]: frequency }

        for word in words:
            if word in frequencies:
                frequencies[word] += 1
            else:
                frequencies[word] = 1

        # highest frequency in front, ordered by smallest lexicographic word first
        list_of_frequencies = sorted(frequencies.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
        return [x[0] for x in list_of_frequencies[:k]]
```

Using the `collections` library:

```python
import collections

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, words: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:
        frequencies = collections.Counter(words)

        # highest frequency in front, ordered by smallest lexicographic word first
        list_of_frequencies = sorted(frequencies.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
        return [x[0] for x in list_of_frequencies[:k]]
```

Using the `heapq` library as well:

```python
import collections
import heapq

# implement a comparable
class Element:
    def __init__(self, count, word):
        self.count = count
        self.word = word

    def __lt__(self, other):
        if self.count == other.count:
            return self.word > other.word

        return self.count < other.count

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.count == other.count and self.word == other.word

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, words: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:
        frequencies = collections.Counter(words)

        # highest frequency in front, ordered by smallest lexicographic word first
        list_of_frequencies = []
        heapq.heapify(list_of_frequencies)

        # min heap, but we remove the smallest elements until there is only the k largest elements remaining
        for word, count in frequencies.items():
            heapq.heappush(list_of_frequencies, (Element(count, word), word))
            if len(list_of_frequencies)> k:
                heapq.heappop(list_of_frequencies)

        result = []
        for i in range(k):
            result.append(heapq.heappop(list_of_frequencies)[1])

        return result[::-1]
```

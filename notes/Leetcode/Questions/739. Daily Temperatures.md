# 739. Daily Temperatures

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/description/

Given an array of integers `temperatures` represents the daily temperatures, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is the number of days you have to wait after the `ith` day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep `answer[i] == 0` instead.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        answer = [0] * len(temperatures)

        stack = [] # strictly decreasing monotonic stack of (temperature, index)

        for i in range(len(temperatures) - 1, -1, -1):
            current_temperature = temperatures[i]

            while len(stack) > 0 and stack[-1][0] <= current_temperature: # keep the stack strictly decreasing
                stack.pop()

            if len(stack) > 0: # there is a temperature after day[i] which is warmer
                answer[i] = stack[-1][1] - i

            stack.append((current_temperature, i))

        return answer
```

# 76. Minimum Window Substring

Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return the minimum window substring of `s` such that every character in `t` (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

# Solution

We will have 2 pointers, a `start` and an `end`, pointing to the search string `s`. We will keep `start` fixed, and keep moving the `end` pointer right, until we meet a valid window (All the characters of `t` are in the string between `start` and `end`).

Then, we contract the window by moving `start` to the right. Everytime we contract the window, we check that the new window is still valid. If it is not valid, we will again continue to fix `start` and move `end` right to expand the window. If the window is still valid, and the new window is smaller, we update the minimum window.

```python
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        needed_letters = collections.Counter(t)
        start = 0
        end = 0
        min_window = ""
        number_of_letters_required = len(t)

        # we increase end until we the target in the search
        for end in range(len(s)):
            if needed_letters[s[end]] > 0: # if we need the letter
                number_of_letters_required -= 1 # we reduce the number of letters we require
            needed_letters[s[end]] -= 1 # update letters we have seen

            # if we have seen all the characters, we try to minimise the window
            while number_of_letters_required == 0:
                window_length = end - start + 1
                if len(min_window) == 0 or window_length < len(min_window): # found a new shorter window
                    min_window = s[start:end+1]

                # remove the start letter by increasing the start index
                needed_letters[s[start]] += 1 # add back the start letter
                if needed_letters[s[start]] > 0:
                    number_of_letters_required += 1 # increase the number of letters we require
                start += 1 # increase the start index

        return min_window
```

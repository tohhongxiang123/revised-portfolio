# 787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops

There are `n` cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array flights where `flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei]` indicates that there is a flight from city `fromi` to city `toi` with cost `pricei`.

You are also given three integers `src`, `dst`, and `k`, return the cheapest price from `src` to `dst` with at most `k` stops. If there is no such route, return `-1`.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findCheapestPrice(self, n: int, flights: List[List[int]], src: int, dst: int, k: int) -> int:
        neighbors = collections.defaultdict(list)
        visited = set()

        for n1, n2, cost in flights:
            neighbors[n1].append((n2, cost))

        pq = [(0, src, k + 1)]
        currentCosts = [[float('inf')] * (k + 1) for i in range(n)]

        while len(pq) > 0:
            cost, currentLocation, numberOfStopsRemaining = heapq.heappop(pq)
            if currentLocation == dst:
                return cost

            if numberOfStopsRemaining > 0:
                for neighbor, newCost in neighbors[currentLocation]:
                    if cost + newCost < currentCosts[neighbor][numberOfStopsRemaining - 1]:
                        currentCosts[neighbor][numberOfStopsRemaining - 1] = cost + newCost
                        heapq.heappush(pq, (cost + newCost, neighbor, numberOfStopsRemaining - 1))

        return -1
```

# 79. Word Search

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/description/

Given an `m x n` grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return `true` if `word` exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

# Solution

DFS

```python
class Solution:
    def dfs(self, board: List[List[str]], i: int, j: int, word: str) -> bool:
        if len(word) == 0:
            return True

        current_letter = board[i][j]
        board[i][j] = "#" # mark as visited

        offsets = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 0)]
        for xOffset, yOffset in offsets:
            neighborX, neighborY = i + xOffset, j + yOffset
            # out of bounds
            if neighborX < 0 or neighborX > len(board) - 1 or neighborY < 0 or neighborY > len(board[0]) - 1:
                continue

            # used
            if (neighborX, neighborY) == "#":
                continue

            # not correct letter
            if board[neighborX][neighborY] != word[0]:
                continue

            if self.dfs(board, neighborX, neighborY, word[1:]):
                return True

        board[i][j] = current_letter # unmark
        return False



    def exist(self, board: List[List[str]], word: str) -> bool:
        for i in range(len(board)):
            for j in range(len(board[i])):
                if board[i][j] == word[0] and self.dfs(board, i, j, word[1:]):
                    return True

        return False
```

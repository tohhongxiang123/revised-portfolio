# 827. Making A Large Island

-   [Leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/making-a-large-island/)

You are given an n x n binary matrix grid. You are allowed to change at most one 0 to be 1.

Return the size of the largest island in grid after applying this operation.

An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1s.

# Solution

We will define a few variables

-   `max`: The maximum sized island we have found. This is initialised at 0
-   `islandID`: A unique identifier for each island in our input. Our initial value for the `islandID` stars from 2. Every time we encounter an island, we will replace the 1s with our `islandID`, to easily identify which island we have encountered
-   `islandSizeMap`: A map of `islandID: sizeOfIsland`

Our procedure will be as follows:

1. We will iterate through each cell in our 2D array
2. If it is a 0, we ignore the cell
3. If it is a 1, we will run DFS from that cell, to figure out which cells are part of the island. We will replace each cell in the corresponding island with `islandID`.
4. Once DFS is done for that specific island, we will also already have the size of the island as well. We will update the `islandSizeMap` with the corresponding `islandID` and `sizeOfIsland`. We will also increment the `islandID`, so that the next island has a different identifier
5. Repeat through all the cells. If we encounter a cell which is a 0, we ignore. If it is a 1, we run DFS. If it is greater than 1, it means we have encountered the cell before (a cell belonging to a previous island), so we skip it as well. Repeat until all have been encountered
6. After processing all the cells in the input matrix, we will go through all the cells a second time.
7. If the number is a 0, we will look at the corresponding 4 neighbors
    1. We want to see what unique islands surround our current cell. If we turn our current cell into land (convert from 0 to 1), this means that the size of the new island is the **sum of the sizes of the unique islands adjacent to our cell** + 1. We can easily compute this using the `islandSizeMap` we have created previously
    2. We keep track of the largest value of the above

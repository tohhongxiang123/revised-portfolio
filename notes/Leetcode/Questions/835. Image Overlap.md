# 835. Image Overlap

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/image-overlap/

You are given two images, `img1` and `img2`, represented as binary, square matrices of size `n x n`. A binary matrix has only `0`s and `1`s as values.

We translate one image however we choose by sliding all the 1 bits left, right, up, and/or down any number of units. We then place it on top of the other image. We can then calculate the overlap by counting the number of positions that have a `1` in both images.

Note also that a translation does not include any kind of rotation. Any `1` bits that are translated outside of the matrix borders are erased.

Return the largest possible overlap.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def largestOverlap(self, img1: List[List[int]], img2: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # get all the coordinates of the ones in both images
        img1Ones = [(i, j) for i in range(len(img1)) for j in range(len(img1[i])) if img1[i][j] == 1]
        img2Ones = [(i, j) for i in range(len(img2)) for j in range(len(img2[i])) if img2[i][j] == 1]

        # inside overlaps, its (x, y): k
        # (x, y) represents how much img2 is offset, and k is how many 1s overlap
        # basically, we check the offset of every 1 in img1 against every 1 in img2 (ax - bx, ay - by)
        # The offset with the largest overlap is the one that appears the most
        overlaps = collections.Counter((ax - bx, ay - by) for ax, ay in img1Ones for bx, by in img2Ones)

        return max(overlaps.values() or [0])
```

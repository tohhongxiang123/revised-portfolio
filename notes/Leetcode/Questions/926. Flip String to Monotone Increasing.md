# 926. Flip String to Monotone Increasing

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-string-to-monotone-increasing/description/

A binary string is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of 0's (possibly none), followed by some number of 1's (also possibly none).

You are given a binary string `s`. You can flip `s[i]` changing it from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.

Return the minimum number of flips to make `s` monotone increasing.

```python
class Solution:
    def minFlipsMonoIncr(self, s: str) -> int:
        numberOfOnes = 0
        result = 0

        for digit in s:
            if digit == "1":
                numberOfOnes += 1
            else:
                result = min(1 + result, numberOfOnes)


        return result
```

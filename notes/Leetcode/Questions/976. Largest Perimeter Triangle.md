# 976. Largest Perimeter Triangle

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-perimeter-triangle/

Given an integer array `nums`, return the largest perimeter of a triangle with a non-zero area, formed from three of these lengths. If it is impossible to form any triangle of a non-zero area, return `0`.

# Solution

Take note of the triangle inequality, which states that for 3 sides of the triangle $A, B, C$:

$$
A + B > C
$$

First, we sort our `nums` array such that the largest number is in front. We let

-   `c = nums[0]`
-   `b = nums[1]`
-   `a = nums[2]`

We need to check if `c < a + b` to ensure that the triangle is a valid triangle

-   We do not need to check if `b < a + c` or `a < b + c` because the array is sorted already
    -   `a < b + c` is definitely true because `a <= b`, therefore `a <= b + c`
    -   `b < a + c` is true because `c >= b`, therefore `c + a > b`

So we will start with the first (biggest) triplet. We check the condition that `c < a + b`. If it is true, we return the perimeter. If not, we continue to the next triplet and repeat. If we run out of triplets, we know that a non-zero area triangle is impossible to create.

```python
class Solution:
    def largestPerimeter(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort(reverse=True)

        for i in range(2, len(nums)):
            if nums[i - 2] < nums[i - 1] + nums[i]:
                return nums[i] + nums[i - 1] + nums[i - 2]

        return 0
```

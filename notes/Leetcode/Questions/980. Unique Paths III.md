# 980. Unique Paths III

You are given an `m x n` integer array grid where `grid[i][j]` could be:

-   `1` representing the starting square. There is exactly one starting square.
-   `2` representing the ending square. There is exactly one ending square.
-   `0` representing empty squares we can walk over.
-   `-1` representing obstacles that we cannot walk over.

Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.

DFS with backtracking

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsIII(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        self.result = 0
        startCoordinates = None
        numberOfCellsRemaining = 1 # includes start

        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[i])):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    startCoordinates = (i, j)
                elif grid[i][j] == 0:
                    numberOfCellsRemaining += 1

        def dfs(x, y, numberOfCellsRemaining):
            # out of bounds or visited
            if x < 0 or x > len(grid) - 1 or y < 0 or y > len(grid[x]) - 1 or grid[x][y] < 0:
                return

            if grid[x][y] == 2:
                if numberOfCellsRemaining == 0: # reached the end and visited all cells
                    self.result += 1
                return # if we reach the end, but have not reached all cells, immediately end

            grid[x][y] = -2 # mark cell as visited
            dfs(x - 1, y, numberOfCellsRemaining - 1)
            dfs(x + 1, y, numberOfCellsRemaining - 1)
            dfs(x, y - 1, numberOfCellsRemaining - 1)
            dfs(x, y + 1, numberOfCellsRemaining - 1)
            grid[x][y] = 0 # unmark cell

        dfs(startCoordinates[0], startCoordinates[1], numberOfCellsRemaining)
        return self.result

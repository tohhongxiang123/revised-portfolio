# 981. Time Based Key-Value Store

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/time-based-key-value-store/

Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for the same key at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a certain timestamp.

Implement the `TimeMap` class:

-   `TimeMap()` Initializes the object of the data structure.
-   `void set(String key, String value, int timestamp)` Stores the key `key` with the value `value` at the given time `timestamp`.
-   `String get(String key, int timestamp)` Returns a value such that set was called previously, with `timestamp_prev <= timestamp`. If there are multiple such values, it returns the value associated with the largest `timestamp_prev`. If there are no values, it returns "".

# Solution

```python
class TimeMap:
    keyVals = {}
    def __init__(self):
        return

    def set(self, key: str, value: str, timestamp: int) -> None:
        if key not in self.keyVals:
            self.keyVals[key] = {}

        self.keyVals[key][timestamp] = value

    def get(self, key: str, timestamp: int) -> str:
        if key not in self.keyVals:
            return ""

        vals = self.keyVals[key]
        if timestamp in vals:
            return vals[timestamp]

        while timestamp > 0:
            if timestamp in vals:
                return vals[timestamp]

            timestamp -= 1

        return ""


# Your TimeMap object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = TimeMap()
# obj.set(key,value,timestamp)
# param_2 = obj.get(key,timestamp)
```

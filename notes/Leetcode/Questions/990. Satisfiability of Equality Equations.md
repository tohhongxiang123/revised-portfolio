# 990. Satisfiability of Equality Equations

-   https://leetcode.com/problems/satisfiability-of-equality-equations/

You are given an array of strings equations that represent relationships between variables where each string equations[i] is of length 4 and takes one of two different forms: "xi==yi" or "xi!=yi".Here, xi and yi are lowercase letters (not necessarily different) that represent one-letter variable names.

Return true if it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations, or false otherwise.

# Solution

We will be using Union-Find

1. We create a union-find set `uf`
2. We loop through all equality equations, and create a union set (since all these variables are supposed to be equal)
3. We loop through all non-equality equations. If the 2 variables in the non-equality equations are in the same union set, this means we have arrived at a contradiction, and return `false`
4. If not, we return `true`

```python
class Solution:
    uf = {}
    def equationsPossible(self, equations: List[str]) -> bool:
        string = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" # Possible variables in the equations
        self.uf = { a: a for a in string }

        for equation in equations:
            v1 = equation[0]
            v2 = equation[3]
            shouldEqual = equation[1] == "="

            if shouldEqual:
                self.uf[self.find(v1)] = self.find(v2)

        for equation in equations:
            v1 = equation[0]
            v2 = equation[3]
            shouldEqual = equation[1] == "="

            if not shouldEqual and self.find(v1) == self.find(v2):
                return False

        return True

    def find(self, v):
        if self.uf[v] == v:
            return v

        return self.find(self.uf[v])
```

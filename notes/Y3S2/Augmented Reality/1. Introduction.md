# What is Augemented Reality?

-   Virtual reality (VR): Users immersed in computer generated environment
-   Augmented reality (AR): Virtual images blended with the real world

Characteristics of AR:

-   Combines **real** and **virtual** images (Both can be seen at the same time)
-   **Interactive** in real time (Virtual content can be interacted with)
-   **Registered** in 3D (Virtual objects appear fixed in space)

## Milgram's Realityâ€“virtuality continuum

A range that scales between completely virtual and completely real

-   Real environment
-   Augmented reality
-   Augmented virtuality
-   Virtual environment

## Metaverse

-   Virtually enhanced physical reality
-   Physically persistent virtual space

-   Augmentation: Technologies that layer information onto our perception of the physical environment
-   Simulation: Technologies that model reality
-   Intimate: Technologies that are focused inwardly, on the identity and actions of the individual or object
-   External: Technologies that are focused outwardly, towards the world at large

Components of Metaverse:

-   Virtual worlds (VR)
-   Augmented Reality (AR)
-   Mirror worlds (Informationally enhanced virtual models of the physical world)
-   Lifelogging (Report the intimate states or life histories of individuals/objects)

# Push-down Automata (PDA)

A PDA extends a finite automata with a stack

A PDA is a tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, q_0, Z_0, A, \delta)$ such that

- $Q$ is a finite set of states
- $\Sigma$ is a finite input alphabet
- $\Gamma$ is the finite stack alphabet
- $q_0 \in Q$ is the initial state
- $Z_0 \in \Gamma$ is the initial stack symbol (bottom of the stack)
- $A \subseteq Q$ is the set of accepting states
- $\delta: Q \times (\Sigma \cup \{ \Lambda \}) \times \Gamma \to 2^{Q \times R^*}$ is a finite transition relation

Note that transitions are now 5-tuples of $(q, a, B, x, q')$

- $q, q' \in Q$ (starting and ending states of transtion)
- $a \in \Sigma$ (input symbol)
- $B \in \Gamma$ (stack symbol)
- $x \in \Gamma^*$ (final contents of stack)

We draw $q \stackrel{a \ B/x}{\rightarrow} q'$ if $(q', x) \in \delta(q, a, B)$

- From state $q$, with input symbol $a$ and stack symbol $B$ (at the top of the stack), we move to $q'$ and replace $B$ with $x$
- We can only pop one symbol off the stack at a time ($B \in \Gamma$), but we can push an entire string onto the stack ($x \in \Gamma^*$)

## Workings of a PDA

The current configuration of a PDA is a combination of $[q, w, x]$ where

- $q \in Q$ is the current state
- $w \in \Sigma^*$ is the word that must still be read
- $x \in \Gamma^*$ is the contents of the stack (top of the stack is on the left)

The effect of a transition $q \stackrel{a \ B/x}{\rightarrow} q'$

- Input symbol $a$ is recognized
- Stack symbol $B$ is tested and popped off the stack
- Stack symbols $x$ are pushed onto the stack (right to left)

In particular,

- $q \stackrel{a \ B/\Lambda}{\rightarrow} q'$: Pop $B$ off the stack
- $q \stackrel{a \ B/B}{\rightarrow} q'$: Test to see if $B$ is on top of the stack
- $q \stackrel{a \ B/C}{\rightarrow} q'$: Test for $B$, replace with $C$
- $q \stackrel{a \ B/CB}{\rightarrow} q'$: Test for $B$, and push $C$ on top

$\delta: Q \times (\Sigma \cup \{ \Lambda \}) \times \Gamma \to 2^{Q \times R^*}$ allows for non-determinism

## Language of a PDA

Let us define a computation step $\vdash$

- If $(q', x) \in \delta(q, a, B)$ then $[q, aw, By] \vdash [q', w, xy]$ ($q \stackrel{a \ B/x}{\rightarrow} q'$)
- If $(q', x) \in \delta(q, \Lambda, B)$, then $[q,w, By] âŠ¢ [q,w, xy]$ ($q \stackrel{\Lambda \ B/x}{\rightarrow} q'$)

We write $\vdash^n$ or $\vdash^*$ to denote $n$ or any number of computational steps

Let $M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, q_0, Z_0, A, \delta)$ be a PDA. The language accepted by $M$ is

$$
L(M) = \{ w \in \Sigma^* \ | \ \exists q, x: q \in A \land [q_0, w, Z_0] \vdash^* [q, \Lambda, x] \}
$$

A word is accepted if there exists some computation from the initial state and stack, to an accepting state that consumes the whole word (regardless of the ending contents of the stack)

- Begin from $[q_0, w, Z_0]$
- Ends with $[q, \Lambda, x]$ for some $q \in A$, and any arbitrary stack with contents $x$

## Every FA can be converted into a PDA

- Set of stack variables is just $\Gamma = \{Z_0\}$
- The stack is never modified
- Regular NFA transition $q \stackrel{a}{\rightarrow} q'$ is converted into a PDA transition $q \stackrel{a \ Z_0/Z_0}{\rightarrow} q'$

# Atomic PDA

An atomic PDA limit the power of a single transition to

- A pop-operation: $q \stackrel{a \ B/\Lambda}{\rightarrow} q'$
- Single push operation: $q \stackrel{a \ B/CB}{\rightarrow} q'$

## Convert PDA to Atomic PDA

For some transition $q \stackrel{a \ B/C_1 \cdots C_n}{\rightarrow} q'$, we can replace it with multiple atomic transitions

$$
q \stackrel{a \ B/\Lambda}{\rightarrow} q_1 \stackrel{\Lambda \ */C_n*}{\rightarrow} q_2 \stackrel{C_n/C_{n-1}C_n}{\rightarrow} q_3 \stackrel{C_{n-1}/C_{n-2}C_{n-1}}{\rightarrow} q_4 \\
\stackrel{C_{n-1}/C_{n-2}C_{n-1}}{\rightarrow} q_5 \cdots \stackrel{\Lambda \ C_2/C_1 C_2}{\rightarrow} q'
$$

## Playing with Acceptance Conditions

### Acceptance by Accepting State

The language $\mathcal{L}_A(M)$ of a PDA $M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, q_0, Z_0, A, \delta)$ is the set of words $w$ with a computation:

- Starting with $[q_0, w, Z_0]$
- Ending with $[q, \Lambda, x]$ with $q \in A$ and $x \in \Gamma^*$

### Acceptance by Empty Stack

The language $\mathcal{L}_E(M)$ of a PDA $M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, q_0, Z_0, A, \delta)$ is the set of words $w$ with a computation:

- Starting with $[q_0, w, Z_0]$
- Ending with $[q, \Lambda, \Lambda]$ with $q \in Q$ ($q$ is not necessarily an accepting state)

> There is also a third variant, acceptance by both empty stack and accepting state

For every language $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$, the following are equivalent:

- A PDA $M$ exists such that $\mathcal{L}_A(M) = L$
- A PDA $M$ exists such that $\mathcal{L}_E(M) = L$

Constructive Proof: Transformations between acceptance conditions

- For every PDA $M$, a PDA $M_1$ exists such that $\mathcal{L}_E(M_1) = \mathcal{L}_A(M)$
- For every PDA $M$, a PDA $M_2$ exists such that $\mathcal{L}_A(M_2) = \mathcal{L}_E(M)$

To construct $M_1$ where $\mathcal{L}_E(M_1) = \mathcal{L}_A(M)$:

- Add new states: $Q' = Q \uplus \{q_s, q_f\}$
  - Include new starting and ending states
- Set the new initial state $q_0' = q_s$
- Add new stack symbol: $\Gamma' = \Gamma \uplus \{Z_1\}$
- Add new transformations
  - $q_s \stackrel{\Lambda \ Z_0/Z_0 Z_1}{\rightarrow} q_0$
  - $q \stackrel{\Lambda \ X/\Lambda}{\rightarrow} q_f$ for all $q \in A \cup \{q_f\}, X \in \Gamma'$
    - For any acceptance state in $M$, we immediately move to a new state $q_f$, and on $q_f$, we empty the whole stack

To construct $M_2$ where $\mathcal{L}_A(M_2) = \mathcal{L}_E(M)$:

- Add new states: $Q' = Q \uplus \{q_s, q_f\}$
- Set the new initial state $q_0' = q_s$
- Add new stack symbol: $\Gamma' = \Gamma \uplus \{Z_1\}$
- Change accepting state $A' = \{q_f\}$
- Add new transformations:
  - $q_s \stackrel{\Lambda \ Z_0/Z_0Z_1}{\rightarrow} q_0$
  - $q \stackrel{\Lambda \ Z_1/\Lambda}{\rightarrow} q_f$ for all $q \in Q$
    - When the stack for $M$ is empty, we are left with $Z_1$. For any state, if we are left with $Z_1$ as the only symbol on the stack, we immediately move to $q_f$ to accept

# Deterministic PDA

In a deterministic PDA (DPDA), the next transition is always unique. Unlike DFAs, we do not include $\Lambda$-transitions, but we restrict them

Let $M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, q_0, Z_0, A, \delta)$ be a PDA. $M$ is deterministic iff:

- For every $q \in Q, a \in \Sigma, X \in \Gamma$, $\delta(q, a, X)$ has at most 1 element
- For every $q \in Q, X \in \Gamma$, $\delta(q, \Lambda, X)$ has at most 1 element
- At least one of $\delta(q, a, X)$ and $\delta(q, \Lambda, X)$ is empty
  - If there exists both a $\delta(q, a, X)$ and a $\delta(q, \Lambda, X)$ on the node, we can only have 1 that exists. If not, it means we have multiple choices for a path, which means it is non-deterministic

A language is deterministic context-free (DCFL) if and only if it is accpted by a DPDA

> Note: DPDAs are weaker than PDAs, because not every language has a PDA. For example, $\{ww^R \ | \ w \in \{a, b\}^*\}$, because the PDA must guess where the middle of the word is

# Transformations between CFGs and PDAs

For every CFG $G$, there exists a PDA $M$ such that $\mathcal{L}(M) = \mathcal{L}(G)$

For every PDA $M$, there exists a CFG $G$ such that $\mathcal{L}_E(M) = \mathcal{L}(G)$ (For convenience, we assume $M$ accepts by the empty stack.)

## From CFG to PDA

1. Push $S$ onto the stack
2. Mimic a left-most derivation

For a CFG $G = (V, \Sigma, S, P)$, we can generate a PDA $M = (\{q_0, q_1, q_2\}, \Sigma, V \cup \Sigma \cup \{Z_0\}, q_0, Z_0, \{q_2\}, \delta)$ with transitions

- $q_0 \stackrel{\Lambda \ Z_0 / S Z_0}{\rightarrow} q_1$ (Push $S$ on the stack)
- $q_1 \stackrel{\Lambda \ Z_0 / Z_0}{\rightarrow} q_2$ (Once stack only has $Z_0$, we are done)
- $q_1 \stackrel{\Lambda \ A/W}{\rightarrow} q_1$ for all $(A \to W) \in P$, where $W \in (V \cup \Sigma)^*$ (Transitions based on production rules in $G$)
- $q_1 \stackrel{a \ a/\Lambda}{\rightarrow} q_1$ for all $a \in \Sigma$ (Consume terminals in $G$)

We can see now that $M$ mimics the leftmost derivations of $G$. So for $x_i \in \Sigma, A \in V, y \in (V \cup \Sigma)^*$:

$$
S \Rightarrow^*_{LM} x_1 \dots x_m Ay \iff [q_1, x_1 \dots x_m, SZ_0] \vdash^* [q_1, \Lambda, AyZ_0]
$$

For example, the grammar $G = \{S \rightarrow aB \ | \ aSB, B \rightarrow b \}$, we can construct a PDA

- $Q = \{q_0, q_1, q_2\}$
- $q_0$ is the initial state
- $A = \{q_2\}$
- Add transitions
  - $q_0 \stackrel{\Lambda \ Z_0/SZ_0}{\rightarrow} q_1$
    - Push $S$ onto the stack
  - $q_1 \stackrel{\Lambda \ Z_0/Z_0}{\rightarrow} q_2$
    - When the stack is only left with $Z_0$, we accept
  - For the transition from $q_1$ to $q_1$
    - Every $A \to w$ becomes a transition $q_1 \stackrel{\Lambda \ A/w}{\rightarrow} q_1$
    - Every terminal/alphabet $a \in \Sigma$ becomes a transition $q_1 \stackrel{a \ a/\Lambda}{\rightarrow} q_1$

## From PDA to CFG

We are given a PDA $M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, q_0, Z_0, A, \delta)$.

The grammar $G = (V, \Sigma, S, P)$ uses variables $Q \times \Gamma \times Q$. Variable $[p, B, q]$ generates all words that move $M$ from state $p$ to $q$ while consuming $B$ from the stack. ($[p, B, q] \Rightarrow^*_G w$ corresponds to $(p, w, B) \vdash^*_M (q, \Lambda, \Lambda)$)

To construct $G$:

- $V = Q \times \Gamma \times Q \cup \{S\}$
- Start rules: Every state is potentially accepting, our task is to consume the stack symbol $Z_0$. So for each $q \in Q$, we add a start rule $S \to [q_0, Z_0, q]$
- Inductive rules: For each PDA transition $p \stackrel{a \ B/C_1 \dots C_n}{\rightarrow} p_1$, we read and consume $B$. But now we need to consume $C_1 \dots C_n$ as well.

  During this process, we can move through arbitrary states. So for all combinations $p_2, \dots, p_n \in Q$ and destination $q \in Q$, we add the rule $[p, B, q] \to a[p_1, C_1, p_2] \cdots [p_n, C_n, q]$

# Deterministic Context-Free Languages

# Pumping Lemma for Context-Free Languages

If there exists a $k \geq 1$ such that, for every $z \in L, |z| \geq k$, there exists $u,v,w,x,y$ such that $z = uvwxy$, and

-   $|vwx| \leq k$
-   $|vx| > 0$
-   $\forall i \geq 0: uv^iwx^iy \in L$

Proof: Assume that $L$ is a context-free language. There is a CFG $G$ such that $\mathcal{L}(G) = L$. WLOG, assume that $G$ is in Chomsky-Normal Form (CNF). Let $G = (V, \Sigma, S, P)$. Set $k = 2^{|V| + 1}$. Let some $z \in L, |z| \geq k$ be given.

Consider a derivation tree $T$ for $z$. Since $G$ is in CNF, $T$ is a binary tree with leaves $z$, and a binary tree of height $n$ has at most $2^n$ leaves. Since $|z| \geq k = 2^{|V| + 1}$, $\text{height}(T) > |V|$. So $T$ must have a path longer than $|V|$. By Pigeonhole Principle, some variable $A \in V$ appeared more than once. Hence we can write: $T = T[u, A[v, A[w], x], y]$ with leaves $uvwxy = z$, $|vx| > 0$ (Since $A$ is binary) and $|vwx| \leq k$ (choose lowest possible A's).

But then, for every $i \geq 0$, we have the derivation $T = T[u, A^i[v, A[w], x], y]$ in $G$, hence $uv^iwx^iy \in L$

A language $L$ is not context free if:

-   For all $k \geq 1$
-   At least 1 $z \in L$ exists such that $|z| \geq k$, and
-   For all $u, v, w, x, y \in \Sigma^*$ with $z = uvwxy, |vwx| \leq k, |vx| > 0$
-   At least 1 $i \geq 0$ exists such that $uv^iwx^iy \not \in L$

## Procedure to Prove A Language is not Context-Free

Consider the language $L = \{ a^i b^i c^i \ | \ i \geq 0 \}$. To prove $L$ is not context free:

-   Assume $L$ is context-free
-   Let $k > 0$ be arbitrarily given
-   Choose $z = a^k b^k c^k$, so $|z| \geq k$ and $z \in L$
-   Let $z = uvwxy$ such that $|vx| > 0$ and $|vwx| \leq k$
-   We distinguish all possible cases of $vwx$
    1. Both $v$ and $x$ contain at most 1 symbol from $\{ a, b, c \}$
        - Then $v = \alpha^m, x = \beta^n$ for some $\alpha, \beta \in \{a, b, c\}$ and $m + n = |vx| > 0$
        - Let $\gamma = \{a, b, c\} - \{\alpha, \beta \}$ be the symbol not in $vx$
        - $u v^2 w x^2 y$ contains more $\alpha$s and/or $\beta$s than $\gamma$s
        - Hence $uv^2wx^2y \not \in L$
    2. Either $v$ or $x$ (but not both) contain 2 different symbols from $\{ a, b, c \}$
        - Then $v^2$ or $x^2$ contains a $b$ before an $a$ or a $c$ before a $b$
        - Choose $i = 2$, then $uv^2wx^2y \not \in L$ since it is not of the form $a^*b^*c^*$
-   Hence, by the pumping lemma, $L$ is not context-free

> Note: The pumping lemma can only prove that $L$ is not context-free. There are non-context-free languages that still satisfy the pumping lemma.

> Make sure to consider all splits of $uvwxy$

# Class of CFLs

The following propositions are equivalent

-   $L$ is a context-free language
-   $L = \mathcal{L}(G)$ for some context-free grammar $G$
-   $L = \mathcal{L}(M)$ for some pushdown automaton $M$
-   $L - \{ \Lambda \} = \mathcal{L}(G)$ for some grammar $G$ in CNF
-   $L = \mathcal{L}_E(M)$ for some empty-stack pushdown automaton
-   $L = \mathcal{L}(M)$ for some atomic pushdown automaton

The following propsitions are all strictly weaker:

-   $L = \mathcal{L}(G)$ for some regular grammar $G$
-   $L = \mathcal{L}(M)$ for some deterministic PDA $M$ (class DFCL)
-   $L = \mathcal{L}(G)$ for some non-ambiguous context-free grammar $G$

The language classes $REG \subset DCFL \subset NAmb \subset CFG$

## Closure Properties of CFLs

The class of CFLs are closed under

-   Union
-   Concatenation
-   Kleene

The class of CFLs are **NOT** closed under

-   Intersection
-   Complement

### Proof of Closure Properties

Consider 2 languages $L_1$ and $L_2$:

-   $L_1 = \mathcal{L}(G_1)$ with $G_1 = (V_1, \Sigma, S_1, P_1)$
-   $L_2 = \mathcal{L}(G_2)$ with $G_2 = (V_2, \Sigma, S_2, P_2)$

Closure under union:

-   $G_1 \cup G_2 = (V_1 \cup V_2 \cup \{S\}, \Sigma, S, P_1 \cup P_2 \cup \{ S \to S_1 | S_2 \})$
-   $\mathcal{L}(G_1 \cup G_2) = L_1 \cup L_2$ is also context-free

Closed under concatenation:

-   $G_1 G_2 = (V_1 \cup V_2 \cup \{S\}, \Sigma, S, P_1 \cup P_2 \cup \{ S \to S_1 S_2 \})$
-   $\mathcal{L}(G_1 G_2) = L_1 L_2$ is also context-free

Closed under kleene:

-   $G_1^* = (V_1 \{S\}, \Sigma, S, P_1 \{ S \to S_1 S \ | \ \Lambda \})$
-   $\mathcal{L}(G_1^*) = L_1^*$ is also context-free

For example, $(a^i b^i \cup ww^R)^*$ is also context free

### Proof of Non-Closure Properties

Not closed under intersection

-   $L_1 = \{a^i b^i c^* \ | \ i \geq 0 \}$ is context-free
-   $L_2 = \{a^* b^i c^i \ | \ i \geq 0 \}$ is context-free
-   $L_1 \cap L_2 = \{a^i b^i c^i \ | \ i \geq 0 \}$ is not context-free (Pumping lemma)

Not closed under complement

-   Consider $L_1, L_2$ as above
-   Assume that CFLs are closed under complement
-   $L_1', L_2'$ are context-free (By assumption)
-   $(L_1' \cup L_2')$ is context-free (closed under union)
-   $(L_1' \cup L_2')'$ is also context-free (By assumption)
-   However $(L_1' \cup L_2')' = L_1 \cap L_2$ is not a context free language
-   Contradiction, hence CFLs are not closed under complement

### Another Closure Property

The intersection of a regular and a context-free language is also context-free

Construct the product of a PDA $M$ and a DFA $N$

$$
M \times N = (Q_M \times Q_N, \Sigma_M \cap \Sigma_N, \Gamma_M, (q_{M0}, q_{N0}), A_M \times A_N, \delta)
$$

-   If $q_1 \xrightarrow{a \ B/W} q_1'$ and $q_2 \xrightarrow{a} q_2'$, then $(q_1, q_2) \xrightarrow{\Lambda \ B/W} (q_1', q_2')$
-   If $q_1 \xrightarrow{\Lambda \ B/W} q_1'$ then $(q_1, q_2) \xrightarrow{\Lambda \ B/W} (q_1', q_2)$

Now $\mathcal{L}(M \times N) = \mathcal{L}(M) \times \mathcal{L}(N)$

> We cannot take the product of 2 PDAs, because that will give us 2 stacks

Example: Proving $L = \{ ww \ | \ w \in \{a, b\}^* \}$ is not context-free

-   Suppose $L$ is context-free
-   Consider the regular language $a^* b^* a^* b^*$
-   $L \cap a^* b^* a^* b^*$ is regular (By the previous theorem)
-   But $L \cap a^* b^* a^* b^* = \{ a^i b^j a^i b^j \ | \ i \geq 0 \}$
-   This is not context free by the pumping lemma
-   Hence, $L$ is not context-free

However, $(ww)'$ is context free

-   Note that $(ww)'$ contains the words that are
    -   odd length with $a$ or $b$ in the center
    -   $z = w_1 w_2$ with $w_1, w_2$ of odd-lenghts, with different centers

Based on these insights, we can generate $G$ which is a context-free grammar

$$
G = \begin{cases}
    S \to A \ | \ B \ | \ AB \ | \ BA \\
    A \to XAX \ | \ a \\
    B \to XBX \ | \ b \\
    X \to a \ | \ b
\end{cases}
$$

## Closure Properties for Determistic CFL (DCFL)

$L$ is deterministic context-free if it is accepted by a DPDA.

-   DFCL are closed under complement (non-trivial to prove)
-   DFCL **not** closed under union (Proved below)
-   DFCL **not** closed under intersection (Because CFLs are not closed under intersection)
-   DFCL is a strict subset of CFL

Note that

-   DPDAs are weaker than PDAs (Recall that $ww^R$ is not determinstic)
-   If $L$ is regular, $L$ is in DFCL (via DFA)
-   If $L_1$ in DFCL, and $L_2$ is regular, then $L_1 \cap L_2$ in DFCL (Product automaton preserves determinism)
-   DCFL is closed under complement (difficult to prove due to $\Lambda$-steps)
-   DCFL are **NOT** closed under union
    -   $L_1 = a^i b^i c^*$ and $L_2 = a^* b^i c^i$
    -   $L_1, L_2$ are DCFL, hence by closure under complement, $L_1', L_2'$ are DCFL
    -   If $L_1' \cup L_2'$ in DCFL, then $(L_1' \cup L_2')'$ is also in DCFL (Closure under complement)
    -   But we saw that $(L_1' \cup L_2')' = L_1 \cap L_2$ is not CFL

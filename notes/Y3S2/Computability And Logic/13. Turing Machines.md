# Turing Machines

Turing machines

-   Finite control (states of mind) similar to FA
-   Infinite tape to store input + intermediate data
-   Computational steps are local (read/write/move one step)
-   Computations can either halt, or continue forever

Significance of Turing Machines

-   A minimalistic model that covers all computations
-   Shows fundamental distinction in software and hardware
-   Enables discussions of undecidable problems, and uncomputable functions

## Turing Machine: Infinite Tape

A Turing Machine has an infinite tape

-   $\Delta$ indicates an empty cell
-   The other symbols on the tape are chosen from a tape alphabet $\Gamma$
-   Tape can be read/overwritten where the **tape head** is located
-   Tape head can move left 1 space, right 1 space, or stay (L, R, S)

## Turing Machine: Single Step

A Turing Machine has a finite set of states ($q \in Q$). A transition $q \xrightarrow{a/bR} q'$ performs the following actions atomically:

-   Condition is checked. $a \in \Gamma$ is at the tape head
-   The symbol $a$ is replaced by $b \in \Gamma$
-   The TM moves from state $q$ to $q'$
-   The tape head moves 1 cell to the right ($R$)

## Turing Machine: Formal Definition

A Turing Machine is a tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, q_0, \delta)$ with:

-   $Q$ is a finite set of states. The halting states $h_a, h_r \not \in Q$
    -   $h_a$: Halt and accept
    -   $h_r$: Halt and reject
-   $q_0$ is the initial state
-   $\Gamma$ is the tape alphabet, with the empty symbol $\Delta \not \in \Gamma$
-   $\Sigma$ is the input alphabet, with $\Sigma \subseteq \Gamma$
-   $\delta: Q \times (\Gamma \cup \{ \Delta \}) \mapsto (Q \cup \{ h_a, h_r \}) \times (\Gamma \cup \{ \Delta \}) \times \{L, R, S \}$ is the **deterministic** transition relation

Note that

-   From a certain point onwards, the tape only contains $\Delta$ (Current contents of the tape is always finite)
-   The configuration of a Turing Machine are elements of $(\Gamma \cup \{ \Delta \})^* \times (Q \cup \{ h_a, h_r \}) \times (\Gamma \cup \{ \Delta \})^* \Delta$

For example,

-   If a TM's tape content is $\Delta a b a b \Delta$, and the tape head is at the leftmost $b$ (with state $q$), we write the configuration as: $\Delta a q b a b \Delta$.
-   If our TM has a transition $q \xrightarrow{b/aR} q'$, then the new state is $\Delta a a q a b \Delta$
    -   The tape head was at $b$, and is replaced by $a$
    -   The tape head is moved 1 step rightwards ($R$)

## Detailed Definition of $\vdash$

Note that $p, q \in Q$, $a, b, c \in \Gamma \cup \{ \Delta \}$, $x, y \in (\Gamma \cup \{ \Delta \})^*$

-   If $p \xrightarrow{a/bS} q$, then $xpay \vdash xqby$
    -   Tape head currently at $a$
    -   $a$ is replaced by $b$
    -   Tape head stays in place ($S$)
    -   State transition from $p$ to $q$
-   If $p \xrightarrow{a/bR} q$, then $xpacy \vdash xbqcy$, or $xpa \vdash xbq\Delta$
    -   Tape head currently at $a$
    -   $a$ is replaced by $b$
    -   Tape head stays in place ($S$)
    -   State transition from $p$ to $q$
    -   Moving beyond the right of the tape results in an extension of the tape (Add $\Delta$ to the back of the word)
-   If $p \xrightarrow{a/bL} q$, then $xcpay \vdash xpcby$ or $pay \vdash h_r by$
    -   Trying to move beyond the left boundary of the tape results in rejection ($h_r$)

# Acceptance By Turing Machine

-   Input word $w$ is put onto the tape, after the first empty cell. Initial configuration: $q_0 \Delta w$
-   The computation of a TM on $w$ leads to 3 different results:
    -   TM halts in the accepting state $h_a$
    -   TM halts in the rejecting state $h_r$
    -   TM loops forever (loops on $w$)

A Turing Machine $M$ accepts a word $w \in \Sigma^*$ iff when it starts with input word $w$, $M$ halts in the halting state:

$$
q_0 \Delta w \vdash^* xh_ay
$$

For some $x, y \in (\Gamma \cup \{ \Delta \})^*$

Note that:

-   We do not consider the contents of the tape after computation
-   We do not care if $w$ is read at all
-   If $w$ leads to an infinite computation, it is not accepted by $M$

# Langugae of Turing Machines

The language accepted by TM $M$ is:

-   $\mathcal{L}(M) := \{w \in \Sigma^* \ | \ M \text{ accepts } w \}$

In other words,

$$
w \in \mathcal{L}(M) \iff \text{$M$ halts in $h_a$ on input $w$}
$$

If $L = \mathcal{L}(M)$, then $L$ is recursively enumerable.

Note that if $w \not \in \mathcal{L}(M)$ means

-   $M$ halted on $h_r$
-   $M$ never halts

# TM to Compute Partial Functions: $(\Sigma^*)^k \to \Sigma^*$

Idea: For $f: (\Sigma^*)^k \to \Sigma^*$, define $dom(f)$:

-   Start with input on the tape $q_0 \Delta x_1 \Delta x_2 \Delta \cdots \Delta x_k \Delta$
-   $(x_1, ... x_k) \in dom(f)$ iff TM $M$ halts in state $h_a$
-   Output of $f$ on $(x_1, ... x_k)$ is written to the tape
-   Tape head moves completely to the left

For all inputs $x_1, ... x_k \in dom(f)$:

$$
q_0 \Delta x_1 \Delta x_2 \Delta \cdots \Delta x_k \Delta \vdash^* h_a \Delta f(x_1, ... x_k) \Delta
$$

and no other input is accepted

## Computable Partial Functions

A partial function $f$ is Turing-computable if there exists a TM $M$ such that $M$ computes $f$

-   Note that a partial function is a binary relation over 2 sets

An example of a partial function $f: (\mathbb{N})^k \mapsto \mathbb{N}$:

-   The simplest unary encoding uses $\Sigma = \{ 1 \}$ and encodes number $n$ as the string $1^n = 111...111$ ($n$ 1's)

$$
q_0 \Delta 1^{m_1} \Delta 1^{m_2} \Delta  \cdots  \Delta 1^{m_k} \Delta  \vdash^âˆ— h_a \Delta 1^{f (m_1,...,m_k)} \Delta
$$

## Relation Between "Computing" and "Accepting a Language"

The characteristic function of a language $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ is the total function

$$
\chi_L(w) = \begin{cases}
    1 & w \in L \\
    0 & w \not \in L
\end{cases}
$$

-   A total function a function which is defined for all inputs of the right type. For example, $x^2$ is a total function

$L$ is a recursive language iff $\chi_L$ is a computable function

We must prove that these 2 statements are equivalent:

1. $L$ is decidable by some TM $M$
2. $\chi_L$ is computed by some TM $M'$

Sketch of proof:

-   $M' \to M$: $M'$ accepts all inputs, so $M$ can move to $h_a$ (on 1) or $h_r$ (on 0)
-   $M \to M'$: $M$ always halts, so $M'$ can write output 0 (in $h_r$) or 1 (in $h_a$)

# Variations of Turing Machines

Standard Turing Machines (as defined so far)

-   Single tape
-   Bounded on the left
-   Deterministic
-   Acceptance by halting in the acceptance state

The following variations are equivalent:

-   Multi-track tape
-   Two-way infinite tape
-   Multiple tapes
-   Non-deterministic
-   Acceptance by halting (not necessarily in the acceptance state)

## Multiple Tapes

Instead of 1 tape, we can have multiple tapes

-   $q \xrightarrow{[x_1/y_1 d_1, x_2/y_2 d_2]} q'$
-   $d_1, d_2 \in \{ L, R, S \}$ may be different

A Multi-Tape Turing Machine is equivalent to a Single-Tape Turing Machine

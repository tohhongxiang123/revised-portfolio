# Variations of Turing Machines

Consider the single tape Turing Machine $M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, q_0, \delta)$. There exists equivalent variations of the single-tape TM:

-   2-sided infinite tape
-   Multiple tracks
-   Non-deterministic

# TMs for Dual Use

The language accepted by some TM $M$:

-   $M$ starts in some configuration $q_0 \Delta w \Delta$
-   $M$ halts in some final state $h_a$, and the result of the tape does not matter ($w_1 h_a w_2$)

$M$ accepts a recursively enumerable language if:

-   $w \in L$: $M$ halts in $h_a$
-   $w \not \in L$: $M$ halts in $h_r$, or never halts (loop infinitely)

$M$ accepts a recursive language if:

-   $w \in L$: $M$ halts in $h_a$
-   $w \not \in L$: $M$ halts in $h_r$
-   Note that $M$ never loops forever

# Relation Between "Computing" and "Accepting" a Language

The characteristic function of a language $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ is the total function:

$$
\chi_L(w) = \begin{cases}
1 \text{ if } w \in L \\
0 \text{ otherwise }
\end{cases}
$$

Theorem: $L$ is a recursive language if and only if $\chi_L$ is computable

We must prove that the 2 statements are equivalent:

-   $L$ is decided by some TM $M$
-   $\chi_L$ is computed by some TM $M'$

Sketch:

-   $M' \to M$: $M'$ accepts all inputs, so $M$ can move to $h_a$ (on 1) or $h_r$ (on 0)
-   $M \to M'$: $M$ always halts, so $M'$ can write output 1 (if $M$ in $h_a$) or 0 (if $M$ in $h_r$)

# Multi-Tape Turing Machines

We have a separate, independent head for each tape

-   $q \xrightarrow{[x_1/y_1 d_1, x_2/y_2 d_2]} q'$
-   $d_1, d_2$ do not have to be equal

> A language is accepted by a multi-tape TM if and only if it is recursively enumerable

Any TM with 2 tapes can be simulated by a TM with 5 tapes. This machine with 5 tracks can be simulated by a machine with a single track of $\Gamma \times \{ X \} \times \Gamma \times \{ X \} \times \{ \# \}$

## Convert Multi-Tape TM to Single-Tape TM

Note that for a $k$-tape TM, we have the extended transition function

$$
\delta^*: Q \times \Gamma^k \to Q \times \Gamma^k \{ L, R, S, \}^k
$$

For each step, we read of content of each of the $k$-tapes, move to the next state, (maybe) write something on each of the $k$-tapes, and (maybe) move each of the $k$ heads.

1. We need to keep track of the position of each head on each track. Thus, for each $\gamma \in \Gamma$, we add the symbol $\underline{\gamma}$. This denotes that the head of a tape is at the symbol
2. We will also introduce a separator $\#$ to $\Gamma$. $\#$ indicates the start and end of each of the $k$ tapes. For example, $\# T_1 \# T_2 \# \cdots \# T_k \#$
3. The transition function of the single-tape machine is a multistage simulation of the multi-tape transition function, where we perform the $k$ different tape actions appropriately, moving up the single tape to each section in turn.

Note that, if we run out of space in tape $T_i$, we will right-shift every other tape $T_{i+1}, ..., T_{k}$. We will never reduce the size of a section

# Combinations of Turing Machines

Several building blocks

-   NB / PB: finding the next/previous blank symbol
-   Copy: take a copy of $x$ and return to the left: $\Delta \times \Delta  \vdash^* \Delta \times \Delta \times \Delta$
-   Insert/Delete symbol: the rest of the string must be shifted
-   Erase tape: this is tricky â€“ we need some end-marker
-   Reverse: compute the reverse of a string and return to the left
-   Equal: test equality of two strings and accept/reject

We write $T_1 \to T_2$ to denote TM $T$ that:

-   Executes according to $T_1$ on some given input on the tape
-   On reaching $h_a$ in $T_1$, starts $T_2$ on the tape contents left by $T_1$
-   Accepts the input/produces output based according to $T_2$

For example, the TM accepting palindromes:

$$
Copy \to NB \to Reverse \to PB \to Equal
$$

This corresponds to

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \underline{\Delta} w \Delta \\
    & \vdash \underline{\Delta} w \Delta w \Delta \\
    & \vdash \Delta w \underline{\Delta} w \Delta \\
    & \vdash \Delta w \underline{\Delta} w^R \Delta \\
    & \vdash \underline{\Delta} w \Delta w^R \Delta \\
    & \vdash h_a \text{ or } h_r \text{ depending on $w = w^r$}
\end{aligned}
$$

Observation: If $T_1$ computes $f$, and $T_2$ computes $g$, then $T_1 \to T_2$ computes $g \circ f$. So, composable functions are closed under function composition

# Non-Deterministic Turing Machine

Recall a Deterministic TM:

$$
\delta: Q \times (\Gamma \cup \{ \Delta \}) \to (Q \cup \{ h_a, h_r \}) \times (\Gamma \cup \{ \Delta \}) \times \{ L, R, S \}
$$

A non-deterministic TM:

$$
\delta: Q \times (\Gamma \cup \{ \Delta \}) \to 2^{(Q \cup \{ h_a, h_r \}) \times (\Gamma \cup \{ \Delta \}) \times \{ L, R, S \}}
$$

There are now multiple transitions for each $(q, a)$

## Language Accepted by Non-Deterministic TM

A word is accepted by an NTM, if there exists some execution $q_0 \Delta w \Delta \vdash^* w_1 h_a w_2$

Note: Some runs might end into $h_r$, or even run forever

# Universal Turing Machine

We can build a single universal turing machine $U$:

-   $U$ gets as input $e(M)$ and $w$
    -   $e(M)$ is the code for Turing Machine $M$
    -   $w$ is some input
-   $U$ "simulates" the computation of $M$ on $w$
-   If $M$ halts on $w$, then $U$ halts as well
-   If $M$ does not halt on $w$, then $U$ does not halt

So

$$
\mathcal{L} = \{e(M)w \ | \ \text{$M$ halts with input $w$}\}
$$

We can see $\mathcal{L}$ is recursively enumerable. However, it is not recursive (Halting problem is undecidable)

# Church-Turing Thesis

A computer is a universal TM

-   $U$ is hardware, and $e(M)$ is software.

The definition of an effective procedure: A procedure is effective if it has the following properties:

-   Complete: The procedure always produces the correct answer
-   Mechanistic: Carrying out the procedure itself requires no intelligence
-   Deterministic: The procedure always returns the same answer

The Church-Turing thesis states that: Every effective procedure can be encoded as a Turing Machine.

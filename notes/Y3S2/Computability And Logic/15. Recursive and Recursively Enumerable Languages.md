# Properties of Recursive Language

## Property 1

If $L$ is recursive, then $\chi_L$ is computable. Recall the characteristic function $\chi_L$

$$
\chi_L(w) = \begin{cases}
1 \text{ if } w \in L \\
0 \text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

## Property 2

Recursive languages are closed under union and intersection

- Intuition: Consider 2 recursive languages $L_1$ and $L_2$, which are decided by $M_1$ and $M_2$ respectively. We run $M_1$ and $M_2$ simultaneously. Both $M_1$ and $M_2$ will halt regardless of input.

## Property 3

Recursive languages are closed under complement

- Let $M$ be the TM that decides $L$
- Now switch $h_a$ and $h_r$ (in a complete, deterministic TM)
- The result is $L'$

# Properties of Recursively Enumerable Languages

## Property 1

If $L$ is recursive, then $L$ is recursively enumerable

- Let some TM $M$ decide $L$. Then $M$ halts on all inputs, either in $h_a$ or $h_r$. So the same $M$ accepts $L$ even though it never hangs for $w \not \in L$

## Property 2

Recursively enumerable languages are closed under union and intersection

- Let $M_1$ and $M_2$ accept $L_1$ and $L_2$ respectively. We simulate $M_1$ and $M_2$ simultaneously in order to accept $L_1 \cap L_2$ or $L_1 \cup L_2$
- If after $n$ steps, $M_1$ halts in $h_a$ or $h_r$, decide or continue with $M_2$ (and vice versa)
- If neither $M_1$ nor $M_2$ halts, then $M$ does not halt ($w \not \in L_1 \cup L_2$ or $L_1 \cap L_2$)

However, recursively enumerable languages are not closed under complement. Intuitively, if $L$ was recursive, we just had to swap $h_a$ and $h_r$. However, when $L$ is recursively enumerable, there is the possibility that $M$ never halts. We cannot just "swap" the outcome of this case.

## Property 3

If $L$ and $L'$ are recursively enumerable, then $L$ is recursive

- Let TM $M_1$ and $M_2$ accept $L$ and $L'$ respectively
- We can build a new TM that simulates $M_1$ and $M_2$ simultaneously
- At least 1 of $M_1$ or $M_2$ will terminate, hence $M$ will terminate and decide $L$
- Proof of at least 1 will terminate:
  - Consider some word $w \in L$. Then $w \not in L'$
  - $w$ will always either be in $L$ or $L'$, hence at least one of them will halt and accept $w$

# Enumerating a Language

Previously, we used a TM to accept a language, or compute a function. Now, we will use a TM to enumerate all elements of $L$ one by one

A multi-tape TM $M$ enumerates a language $L$ if $M$ keeps writing $x_1 \Delta x_2 \Delta \cdots$ to tape 1, where $\biguplus_i \{ x_i \} = L$

- So $M$ enumerates all words in $L$ one by one in some arbitrary order
- Also $M$ writes each word in $L$ exactly once (no duplicates)
- If $w \in L$, it will eventually show up on the tape
- However if $w \not \in L$, we will never know (consider infinite languages, where $M$ writes forever)

Theorem: $\exists M_1 (M_1 \text{ enumerates } L) \iff \exists M_2 (M_2 \text{ accepts } L)$

- (Forward argument) $M_2$ waits until $M_1$ writes $w$ on tape 1, then $M_2$ accepts. Else, $M_2$ never halts
- (Backward argument) $M_1$ checks, for increasing $n$, if $M_2$ accepts $x_1, ..., x_n$ in $n$ steps

# Enumerating in Canonical Order

It makes a big difference if we can enumerate $L$ in a fixed order

- Here we use the canonical order: $\Lambda, 0, 1, 00, 01, 000, 001, 010, 011, ...$

Note: A TM $M$ can easily enumerate $\Sigma^*$ in canonical order

Theorem: There exists some TM $M_1$ that enumerates $L$ in canonical order iff there exists some other TM $M_2$ that decides $L$

- (Forward argument) $M_2$ will simulate $M_1$, and wait until $M_1$ writes $w$ on tape 1. But $M_2$ halts and rejects as soon as $M_1$ proceeds beyond $w$ in canonical order
- (Backward argument) $M_1$ checks (decides) for increasing $n$, using $M_2$, if $x_n \in L$. If $M_2$ accepts $x_n$, then $M_1$ writes $x_n$ to tape 1, otherwise $n = n + 1$

The assumption that the words can be enumerated in canonical order is fundamental: Now we can know when to "stop waiting"

# Undecidability

Recall the universal Turing Machine. Let $e(M)$ be some encoding function $e(M) \in \{0, 1\}^*$, which takes a TM $M$ and outputs an encoding of $M$. A universal TM $U$ is defined:

- $U$ accepts $e(M)w$ iff $w \in \mathcal{L}(M)$ \iff $M$ accepts $w$

Let $E = \{ e(M) \ | \ M \text{ is a TM} \}$. So $E$ contains strings that encode a TM. Note that

1. $e$ is injective, so if $e(M_1) = e(M_2)$, then $M_1 = M_2$
2. $E$ is recursive, hence $E'$ is recursive as well

Definition: Language SA (Self-accepting)

$$
\begin{aligned}
SA &= \{ e(M) \ | \ e(M) \in \mathcal{L}(M) \} \\
&= \{ e(M) \ | \ M \text{ accepts } e(M) \}
\end{aligned}
$$

Definition: Language NSA (Not self-accepting)

$$
\begin{aligned}
NSA &= \{ e(M) \ | \ e(M) \not \in \mathcal{L}(M) \} \\
&= \{ e(M) \ | \ M \text{ does not accepts } e(M) \}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that $\Sigma^* = NSA \uplus SA \uplus E'$

## Theorem 1

NSA is not recursively enumerable

- Assume NSA is recursively enumerable
- NSA = $\mathcal{L}(M)$ for some particular TM $M$
- Then $e(M) \in NSA \iff e(M) \not \in NSA$

SA is recursively enumerable

- Define some TM $T$ that checks if $w \in E$. If not, $w \not \in SA$, so it rejects
- Otherwise, $w = e(T)$. Copy $w$, and run $U$ on $ww = e(T)e(T)$. $U$ accepts $ww$ iff $e(T) \in \mathcal{L}(T)$, so $w \in SA$

SA is not recursive

- If SA were recursive, then $NSA' = SA \cup E'$ would be recursive
- Then NSA would be recursive, however we have shown that NSA is not even recursively enumerable

# The Halting Problem is Undecidable

Input: TM $M$ and word $w$. Will $M$ halt on $w$?

Theorem: The Halting Problem is recursively enumerable

- Recall that this language is accepted by the Universal Turing Machine $U$
- If $M$ accepts and halts on $w$, $U$ halts and accepts
- If $M$ rejects and halts on $w$, $U$ halts and rejects
- If $M$ never halts on $w$, $U$ also never halts

Theorem: The Halting Problem is recursive

- Proof by contradiction using self-reference and "diagonal" argument

## Undecidability of the Halting Problem

Assume that we have a solution: A TM $H$ which solves the Halting Problem

- Given an encoding $e(M)$ and word $w$, $H$ will halt and tell us whether $M$ halts on $w$
- We transform $H$ into $H'$, negating the results
  - If $M$ halts on $w$, $H'$ tells us $M$ will never halt
  - If $M$ never halts on $w$, $H'$ tells us $M$ will halt
- Use the encoding of $M$ as input $w$
  - Take TM $M$, encode it into $e(M)$
  - Copy $e(M)$ to get $e(M)e(M)$
  - Pass $e(M)e(M)$ through $H'$
  - If $M$ halts on $e(M)$, $H'$'s output is "never halt"
  - If $M$ does not halt on $e(M)$, $H'$'s output is "halt"
- We call the above TM as $D$
  - $D$ takes in some encoding $e(M)$ and tells us the opposite of whether $M$ halts on $e(M)$
- We now pass the encoding of $D$ itself ($e(D)$) into $D$
- We will get a contradiction everytime
  - If $D$ halts on $e(D)$, $D$ will tell us "$D$ will not halt on $e(D)$ (And vice versa)
- Hence, the original Turing Machine can never exist

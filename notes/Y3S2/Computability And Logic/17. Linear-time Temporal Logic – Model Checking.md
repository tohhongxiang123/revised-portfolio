# Linear-time Temporal Logic – Model Checking

Linear-Time Temporal Logic (LTL) is a logic to specify properties over infinite words

-   Safety
    -   Nothing bad can happen
-   Liveness
    -   Something good will eventually happen

Temporal logic

-   We will still have propositions, but truth values can change over time

Model checking for LTL:

-   Model the system as an automaton $A$
-   Model the requirements as LTL formula $\varphi$
-   Check if $A \models \varphi$ (all infinite runs of the system satisfy the requirement)

$$
\varphi ::= p \ | \ \neg \varphi \ | \ \varphi \land \varphi \ | \ \varphi \lor \varphi \ | \\
X \varphi \ | \ F \varphi \ | \ G \varphi \ | \ \varphi U \varphi \ | \ \varphi W \varphi
$$

LTL formulae use **propositional** and **temporal** operators

-   $\psi$ and $\varphi$ are LTL formulae, interpreted over a finite path $\pi_0, \pi_1, ...$
-   $X \varphi$: $\varphi$ holds in the next state of the path (neXt)
-   $F \varphi$: $\varphi$ holds up somewhere in the future (Future)
-   $G \varphi$: $\varphi$ holds everywhere in the path (Globally)
-   $\varphi U \psi$: $\psi$ will hold, and $\varphi$ will hold until then (Until)
    -   $\psi$ is true at some future state, and $\varphi$ is true at each state until then
-   $\varphi W \psi$: $\varphi$ holds until $\psi$ will hold (Weak until)

Some examples:

-   $\varphi \lor \psi = \neg (\neg \varphi \land \psi)$ (De morgans)
-   $G \varphi = \neg F \neg \varphi$ ($\varphi$ holds globally, $\neg \varphi$ never holds in the future)
-   $F \varphi = \text{true} U \varphi$
-   $\varphi W \psi = (\varphi U \psi) ∨ (G \varphi )$

Frequent LTL examples:

-   This lecture will eventually end: $F \text{finish}$
-   I will never make an error $G \neg \text{error}$
-   I will not make mistakes in this lecture $(\neg \text{error}) U \text{finish}$
-   Every request will be acknowledged: $G(\text{req} \to F \text{ack})$
-   Every single request will be acknowledged: $G (\text{req} \to X (\neg \text{req} U \text{ack}))$
-   $p$ happens infinitely often: $G F p$
-   Every stubborn request will be granted: $(G F \text{req}) \to F \text{grant}$
-   $F G p$: $p$ almost always holds

# Models: Transition Systems

A Kripke structure is a transition system $(A, S, \to, L)$

-   $S$ is a finite set of states
-   $\to$ is a binary and total transition relation
-   $A$ is the set of atoms (atomic propositions)
-   $L: S \to 2^A$ is the labelling function

Kripke structures combine the finite automata $(S, \to)$ with propositional valuations $(A, L)$. That is, the labels are on the states, rather than the transitions

A path $\pi$: An infinite set of states $\pi_1, \pi_2, ...$ with $\forall i (\pi_i \to \pi_{i+1})$

-   We use $\omega$ to denote infinite repetition. E.g. $abc(ab)^\omega$
-   $\pi_i \in S$: The $i$-th state in the path $\pi$
-   $pi^i$: The path starting from $i$, which is $\pi_i, \pi_i+1, ...$

# Satisfiability for Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)

A CNF: $(a \lor b \lor c) \land (d \lor e) \land f$

- Terms connected by conjunctions

SAT: Boolean satisfiability for CNF

- Input: A propositional formula $\phi$ in CNF
- Question: Is there a satisfying assignment for $\phi$?

Examples of satisfiable formulas

- $a \land b$
- $(x_1 \land x_2 \land \neg x_3)$

Examples of unsatisfiable formulas

- $x \land \neg x$

Example satisfiability problem:

- Adam can only meet on monday and wednesday
- Bridget cannot meet on tuesday
- Charles cannot meet on friday
- Darren can only meet on thursday or friday

Can we schedule a meeting on Monday-Friday for them?

$$
(x_1 \lor x_3) \land \neg x_2 \land \neg x_5 \land (x_4 \lor x_5) \implies \text{AtMostOne}(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)?
$$

This formula is unsatisfiable

# Result and Experiences on SAT

SAT is NP-complete

- No polynomial algorithm to solve SAT
- However, there are many SAT problems that still can be solved easily, even when very large
- We can encode every problem in NP into a SAT problem
- The theoretical encoding simulates a Turing Machine

# Applications

## Graph Coloring

- Input: A graph $G = (V, E)$, and a number $k$
- Output: An assignment $c: V \to \{1, ..., k\}$ such that $\forall x \forall y (x E y \to c(X) \neq c(Y))$
  - Color each node in $G$ with a color, such that no 2 nodes that are connected have the same color

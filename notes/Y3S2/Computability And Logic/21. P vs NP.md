# P vs NP

# P

Class $P$ contains the set of languages $L$ (problems) that are decided by some TM $M$ in polynomial time

$$
L \in P \iff \exists M \exists k (M \text{ decides } L \text{ and } \tau_M(n) = O(n^k))
$$

Note that $\tau_M(n)$ is the max number of moves by $M$ on any input $w$ of length $n$

We call these languages in $P$ feasible.

# NP

Class $NP$ is the set of languages that are accepted by some non-deterministic TM $M$ in polynomial time

$$
L \in NP \iff \exists M \exists k (M \text{ accepts } L \text{ and } \tau_M(n) = O(n^k))
$$

-   We can simulate a non-deterministic TM with a deterministic one
-   However, we would need "back-tracking" search (Which requires exponential time)

# Basic Facts about $P$ and $NP$

$P \subseteq NP$

-   Every deterministic TM is also a non-deterministic TM

$L \in NP \iff L$ has a polynomial verifier

-   Let $L \in NP$, so it is accepted by some non-deterministic TM $M$ in polynomial time. Let $w \in L$, and check $w\$v$, where $v$ is just the run of $M$ of length $\leq p(|w|)$
-   Let $L$ have a verifier $M$ with polynomial time $p(n)$. Let $w \in L$, let $M'$ be a NTM guess proof $v$ of length $p(n)$ and verify $w\$v$ as $M$

Closure properties

-   $P$ closed under union, intersection, complement
-   $NP$ closed under intersection, union

NP is at most exponential deterministic time

-   If $L \in NP$, then $L$ is decided by a TM $M$ with a time complexity of $O(2^{p(n)})$

# Co-NP

Co-NP is the set of languages $L$ such that $L' \in NP$

-   It is unknown if $NP$ is closed under complement

# NP-Hard and NP-Complete

A problem $L$ is NP-Hard if for every $L_1$ in NP, $L_1 \leq_P L$

-   Every problem in NP can be reduced to $L$ in polynomial time
-   A polynomial time reduction is a function $f: \Sigma_1^* \to \Sigma_2^*$ such that
    -   $w \in L_1 \iff f(w) \in L_2$
    -   $f$ is computable in polynomial time
-   We write $L_1 \leq_P L_2$ if there exists a reduction from $L_1$ to $L_2$
-   If $L_2 \in P$ and $L_1 \leq_P L_2$, then $L_1 \in P$

A problem $L$ is NP-Complete iff $L \in NP$ and $L$ is NP-Hard

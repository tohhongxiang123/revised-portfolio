# Distinguishability and Minimisation

To minimise a DFA, we need to learn about equivalence classes

# Equivalence Classes

Let $x$ be a set and $R$ be a **binary relation** over $x$

- $R \subseteq X \times X$ or $R \in 2^{X \times X}$

We say elements $a$ and $b$ are related if $a R b$ or $(a, b) \in R$

- For example, $3 \leq 5$ where $\leq$ is a binary relation on $\mathbb{N}$

A binary relation $R$ on $X$ is an **equivalence relation** if all of the following holds:

- Reflexivity: $\forall a \in X,  \ (a \ R \ a)$
- Symmetry: $\forall a, b \in X, (a \ R \ b) \implies (b \ R \ a)$
- Transitivity: $\forall a, b, c \in X, (a \ R \ b) \land (b \ R \ c) \implies (a \ R \ c)$

Example: $=$ is a equivalence relation, while $\leq$ is reflexive and transitive but not symmetric

An equivalence relation $\approx S \times S$ gives us **equivalence classes**. The class $x \in S$ is denoted by $[x]$, so $\{y \in S \ | \ x \approx y\}$

All equivalence classes form a **partition** in $S$

- All equivalence classes are disjoint: $[x] = [y]$, or $[x] \cap [y] = \empty$
- They completely cover $S$: $\bigcup_{x \in S} [x] = S$
- The set of equivalence classes is sometimes written as $S / \approx$

## Defining Equivalence Class Functions

How to define a functino $F$ on equivalence classes? $F: S / \approx \ \mapsto T$

Typically, we use some function $f: S \mapsto T$ and then we define:

$$
F([x]) := f(x)
$$

for some arbitrary representative $x$

This is because of **proof obligation**,

$$
\forall x, y \in S: x \approx y \implies f(x) = f(y)
$$

Consider the example $\mathbb{N} / \equiv_5$ (Congruent modulo 5)

- $f([x]) := [x + 3]$ makes sense
- $g([x]) := [2^x]$ does not

That is, if $x \equiv_5 y$ then $[x + 3] = [y + 3]$ but $[2^x] \neq [2^y]$

# Distinguishability

For a language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$,

- Words $x$ and $y$ are distinguished by $z$ iff $xz \in L \iff yz \not \in L$

For example, consider the language $L = \{waa \ | \ w \in {a, b}^âˆ— \}$ (words that end with $aa$)

- $a$ and $b$ are distinguished by $a$: $aa \in L$ but $ba \not \in L$
- $b$ and $aa$ are not distinguished by $b$: $bb \not \in L$ and $aab \not \in L$
- $a$ and $aa$ are distinguished by $\Lambda$: $a\Lambda \not \in L$ but $aa\Lambda \in L$
- $aa$ and $aaa$ cannot be distinguished: $\forall z (aaz \in L) \iff (aaaz \in L)$

## Definition of (In)distinguishability

Words $x$ and $y$ are $L$-indistinguishable if there is no distinguishing word $z$. i.e. $\forall z (xz \in L \iff yz \in L)$

Continuing from the previous example where $L = (a + b)^*aa$ (words ending with aa), we have 3 equivalence classes

- $\Lambda =_L b =_L bb =_L ab =_L \cdots$ (Ending with not a)
- $a =_L ba =_L aba =_L bba =_L \cdots$ (Ending with 1 a)
- $aa =_L baa =_L aaa \cdots$ (Ending with 2 a's)

From the equivalence classes, we now can tell that the DFA for $L$ requires only 3 states

# Minimisation of DFA

Given a DFA $M = (Q, \Sigma, q_0, A, \delta)$

- Unreachable states can be removed from $Q$
- Equivalent states can be combined into a single state

2 states $q_1$ and $q_2$ are considered equivalent if they accept the same language:

$$
L((Q, \Sigma, q_1, A, \delta)) = L((Q, \Sigma, q_2, A, \delta))
$$

## Distinguishability Relation $\mathcal{D} \subseteq Q \times Q$

$\mathcal{D}$ is defined inductively as the smallest relation such that for all $q_i, q_j \in Q$ and for all $a \in \Sigma$:

1. If $(q_i \in A \iff q_j \not \in A)$ then $\mathcal{D}(q_i, q_j)$ (In this case, $\Lambda$ distinguishes $q_i$ and $q_j$)
2. If $\mathcal{D}(\delta(q_i, a), \delta(q_j, a))$ then $\mathcal{D}(q_i, q_j)$ (If $w$ distinguishes $q_k = \delta(q_i, a)$ and $q_l = \delta(q_j, a)$, then $aw$ distinguishes $q_i$ and $q_j$)

## Minimisation of a DFA Algorithm

Maintain an array $D[i, j]$ which represents if $(q_i, q_j) \in \mathcal{D}$ for $i < j$

- If $D[i,j]$ is empty, states $q_i$ and $q_j$ are indistinguishable so far
- If $D[i,j] = n$, states $q_i$ and $q_j$ can be distinguished in $n$ steps

We compute $D[i,j]$ iteratively:

1. Starting point
   - $A$-states are distinguishable from $Q / A$-states by word $\Lambda$ (Distinguishing accepting vs non-accepting states)
   - So for every $q_i \in A, q_j \not \in A$, mark $D[i,j] = 0$
2. Check for all pairs $(i, j)$ for which $D[i,j]$ is empty, and for each $a \in \Sigma$:
   - Compute the $a$-successors $q_k = \delta(q_i, a)$ and $q_l = \delta(q_j, a)$
   - If $D[k, l] = n$, then mark $D[i, j] := n + 1$
3. If some new pairs were marked, repeat step 2

If $D[i,j]$ are empty in the end, then $q_i$ and $q_j$ are indistinguishable

## Notes

- Minimisation only works for deterministic and complete DFA
- The result is an equivalent DFA, which is the minimal DFA
- Possible that there exists a smaller NFA

# Indistinguishability and Finite Automata

## Pairwise Distinguishable Words

Let $S \subseteq \Sigma^*$ be some set of words. The words in $S$ are pairwise distinguishable in $L$ if every pair of elements can be distinguished

$$
\forall x, y \in S (x \neq y \implies x \neq_L y)
$$

Now let $M = (Q, \Sigma, q_0, A, \delta)$ be an arbitrary DFA for $L$

Then, if $x$ and $y$ are $L$-distinguishable, then $\delta^*(q_0, x) \neq \delta^*(q_0, y)$

If we find $n$ pairwise $L$-distinguishable words, then $|Q| \geq n$

# Myhill-Nerode Theorem

Let $L$ be some language over an alphabet $\Sigma$. Let $Q_L$ be the set of equivalence classes induced by $=_L$.

Then

$$
Q_L \text{ is finite} \iff \text{There is a DFA $M$ with $L(M) = L$}
$$

The automaton is: $M := (Q, \Sigma, [\Lambda]_L, A, \delta)$ where

$$
\begin{aligned}
A & := \{ q \ \in Q_L \ | \ q \subseteq L \} \\
\delta([x]_L, a) & := [xa]_L
\end{aligned}
$$

Moreover, $M$ of size $|Q_L|$ is the smallest DFA that accepts $L$

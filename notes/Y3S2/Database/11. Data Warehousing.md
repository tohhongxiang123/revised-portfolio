# Data Warehousing

Tools that provide decision makers with information to make decisions quickly and reliably, based on historical data

- Traditional databases are optimised for querying and updating
- However, data warehouse users only need read access
- Used for analytics, such as "What type of customers do I have?" or "Who buys products on sale?"

A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, non-volatile, time-variant collection of data in support of management's decisions

Data warehouses support

- OLAP (Online analytical processing): Analysis of complex data from the data warehouse
- DSS (Decision support system): also known as EIS (Executive information system) or MIS (Management information system), used to support organisation's leading decision makers
- Data mining
- Ad-hoc queries: Interest driven, posed by users only once or seldomly
- Canned queries: Apriori defined queries with parameters that recur frequently
- Typically business oriented

The structure of a data warehouse:

- Cleaning and reformatting of data
- OLAP
- Data mining

# Data Modelling for Warehouses

Measures on what we would like to know about (eg. sales)

- Relate these measures to different attributes
- Can be represented as a 2D spreadsheet/table

Multidimensional models

- Querying performance for analysis in a multi-dimensional data storage model is much more efficient
- Data warehouses can take advantage of such features because they are non-volatile with a high degree of predictability

Advantages of multi-dimensional models

- Easy to make hierarchical views aka roll-up displays and drill-down displays
- Data can be queried in any combination of dimensions, bypassing complex database queries

Multi-dimensional schemas are defined using

- Dimension table
  - Consists of tuples of attributes of the dimension
  - E.g. product1, product2, ...
- Fact table
  - Each table is a recorded fact
  - Each fact contains some measured or observed variables

Star-schema

- An example of a multi-dimensional schema
- Consists of a fact table, with a single fact table for each dimension

Snowflake-schema

- Variation of star-schema
- Dimensional tables from a star-schema are organised into a hierarchy through normalisation

Fact constellation

- Set of tables that share some dimension tables
  - Can be viewed as a collection of many star-schemas
  - Also called a galaxy schema
- More complex than star or snowflake because of multiple fact tables
  - Flexible, but harder to manage

# Building a Data Warehouse

Requires analysis of anticipated usage of warehouse

- What are typical queries on the warehouse
- Design must still be able to support ad-hoc queries
- Appropriate schema usually depends on anticipated usage

Designing of schema usually involves the following steps:

- Acquisition of data for the warehouse
- Ensuring data storage meets query requirements efficiently
- Giving full consideration to the environment in which the data warehouse resides

# ETL: Data Acquisition

A large amount of effort for data warehousing is ETL: Extract, transform, load

- Process of inserting data from transactional databases
  - Different source databases, each with different schemas
- Cleaning
  - Validity and quality of data
  - Erroneous and incomplete data make cleaning and querying difficult
  - Corrected data can be backflushed into the transactional database (e.g. incorrect customer address)
- Converted to data model of data warehouse
- Loading of large volumes of data is challenging
  - Usually done incrementally: Go offline for a particular time at regular intervals

# Warehouse vs Data Views

Views and data warehouses are similar in that they both have read-only extracts from the database

However, data warehouses are different from views in the following ways:

- Data warehouses exist as persistent storage instead of being materialized on demand
- Date warehouses are not usually relational, but multi-dimensional
- Data warehouses can be indexed for optimisation
- Data warehouses provide specific support of functionality
- Data warehouses deal with large volumes of data that is contained in more than one database

# Navigating Data Warehouses

Functionality to navigate and study data

- Roll-up: Data is summarised with increasing generalisation
- Drill-down: Increasing levels of details are revealed
- Pivot: Cross-tabulation is performed
- Slice and dice: Performing projections on the dimensions
- Sorting: Data is sorted by some ordinal value
- Selection: Data is available by value or range
- Derived attributes: New attributes that are computed on existing stored values

## Roll-Up

Provides means to "move up the hierarchy"

- Aggregate from smaller to larger regions or from more fine-grained to coarser product categories

## Drill-Down

Opposite of roll-up

- Provides finer level information e.g. on sub-regions

## Pivoting

Same data, same resolution of dimensions, but rotated

- Allow for "reading" along a different "axis"

# Difficulties of Implementing Data Warehouses

- Lead time is huge in building a data warehouse
  - Potentially takes years to build and efficiently maintain
- Both quality and consistency of data is a major concern
  - Data schemas can change throughout a lifetime
- Revising usage projections regularly to meet current requirements
  - Data warehouse must be designed to accomdate addition and attrition of data sources, without major redesign
- Administration of data warehouse requires different skills from a traditional database

# Classification of Data Warehouses

- Generally, data warehouses are a lot larger than traditional databases
- Sheer volume of data is an issue, based on which data warehouse
  - Enterprise-wide data warehouse: Huge projects requiring massive investment of time and resources
  - Virtual data warehouses: Provide views of operational databases, that are materialised for efficient access
  - Data marts: Generally targeted to a subset of the organisation, such as a department, and are more tightly focused

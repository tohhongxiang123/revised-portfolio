# Distributed Databases

A distributed computing system

-   Multiple processing sites/nodes
-   Interconnected via network
-   Cooperate in performing certain assigned tasks
-   Partition big problem into smaller pieces
-   Solve efficiently in a coordinated manner
-   Easy way to use more computing problem, however small overhead of communication between nodes

Distributed database

-   Collection of multiple logically related databases
-   Distributed over computer network
-   Distributed database management system as a software system

# Transparency

-   Hide implementation details from user
-   Offers flexibility to user/developer
-   More challenging than in traditional databases with only logical and physical data independence

Advantages

-   Management of distributed data with different levels of transparency
-   Physical placement of data unknown to user (Distribution transparency)

# Distribution and Network Transparency

Users do not worry about operational details of the network

-   Location transparency
    -   Issue command from any site
    -   Data can be located on any site
-   Naming transparency
    -   Access to any names object (file, relations, etc.) from any site
    -   Requires unambiguous names regardless of location, without specifying location

# Replication and Fragmentation Transparency

Replication transparency

-   Allow storing copies of data at multiple sites
-   Minimise access time to the data

Fragmentation transparency

-   Allow storing tuples or attributes at different sites

# Horizontal and Vertical Fragmentation

Horizontal fragmentation

-   Also called sharding
-   Horizontal subset of relation with tuples which satisfy select condition
    -   Take certain rows that satisfy a condition together, and store it somewhere
    -   $\sigma_{C_i}(R)$
    -   $\bigcup_{\forall i} \sigma_{C_i}(R) = R$
    -   $\forall i, j, i \neq j, \sigma_{C_i}(R) \cap \sigma_{C_j}(R) = \emptyset$
    -   Reconstruction through union of all fragments

Derived horizontal fragmentation

-   Partitioning of primary relation to other secondary relations via foreign keys
-   Related data usually kept together

Vertical fragmentation

-   Subset of relation created by subset of columns
    -   Vertical fragment contains values of selected columns
    -   No selection condition used in vertical fragmentation
    -   Split columns up and store them
    -   $\Pi_{L_i}(R)$
    -   $\bigcup_{\forall i} L_i = \text{ATTRS}(R)$
    -   $\forall i, j, \Pi_{L_i}(R) \cap \Pi_{L_j}(R) = PKEY(R)$
    -   Reconstruction through full outer join of all fragments
-   Each fragment must include the primary key of the relation

# Mixed Fragmentation

Combination of vertical and horizontal fragmentation

-   $\Pi_{L_i}(\sigma_{C_i}(R))$

# Schema

Fragmentation schema

-   A definition of the set of fragments
-   Includes all attributes and tuples in the database
-   Satisfy condition that whole database can be reconstructed from the fragments
-   Applying some sequence of `UNION` or `OUTER JOIN` operations

Allocation schema

-   Describes distribution of fragments to sites of distributed databases
-   Fully or partially replicated or partitioned
-   Replicated means stored at more than one site

# Data Distribution and Replication

Data replication

-   Database is replicated to different sites
-   In full replication, the entire database is replicated
-   In partial replication, some selected part of the database is replicated to some site
-   Achieved through a replication schema

Data distribution (Data allocation)

-   Relevant only in the case of partial replication or partition
-   Selected portion of the database is distributed to the database sites

# Query Processing in Distributed Databases

Cost of transferring data over network is high. Hence optimisation is required

-   Aim to minimise amount of data sent over network
-   Usually, transfer the smaller relation to the bigger relation's site
-   In joins, we can do a projection of the join attributes of the smaller relation, send these over to the bigger relation's site, and then join

# Homogeneous Distributed Database System

-   All sites of database system have the identical setup
-   Underlying operating system may be different

# Heterogeneous Distributed Database System

-   Federated: Each site may run different database system, but data is managed through a single conceptual schema
    -   Degree of local autonomy is minimal
    -   Each site must adhere to some centralized access policy
    -   There may be a global schema
-   Multidatabase: There is no single global schema
    -   For data access, schema is dynamically constructed as needed by the application

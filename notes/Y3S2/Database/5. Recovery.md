# Recovery

Recovery is used to handle failures

-   DBMS is responsible for handling any transactions submitted

Types of failures

-   System crash: Hardware, network, software etc.
-   Transaction or system error: Division by zero, erroneous parameter values, logical programming errors
-   Local errors, non-handled exceptions: Data not found, insufficient funds for withdrawal etc
-   Concurrency control enforcement: Aborted transactions due to deadlocks, serializability violations etc
-   Disk failure: Issue with read/write during transaction operations
-   Physical problems/catastrophes

DBMS must maintain ACID properties when things go wrong

# What to do when crash?

There are times when you need to redo a transaction, or undo, or both, or neither

## Buffer Pool Management

Database operates:

-   Load data from disk to do work in main memory
    -   Creates dirty pages that contains changes not yet written to disk
-   OS will write to disk at some point
    -   DBMS may need to force writes to ensure durability

## Log Based Recovery

General idea: Keep track of modifications to the data using logs

-   Log manager records important events such as writes to a log
    -   When transaction T starts: `<T starts>` written to logs
    -   When T modifies X with a write: `<T, X, old: V, new: W>` written to log
    -   Logs must be stored in stable storage
-   When T reaches the last statement, `<T commits>` written to logs, and T commits
    -   Commit precisely when commit entry (after all previous entries of T) is written to the log

# Buffering of Log Entries and Data Items

-   We have assumed so far that logs are written to stable storage
-   We are able to lift this restriction, and place logs in the cache to yield better performance
-   However, we must impose the following restrictions:
    -   Transaction T cannot commit before `<T commits>` is written to stable storage
    -   `<T commits>` cannot be placed on stable storage before all other entries for T are on stable storage
    -   A block of data items cannot be output to stable storage until all log entries pertaining to data items are output

# Undo/Redo Algorithm (Immediate DB Modification)

Following a failure,

-   Redo all transactions with `start` and `commit`
-   Undo all transactions with `start` but no `commit`

Remarks

-   In a multitasking system, more than 1 transaction may need to be undone
-   If system crashes during recovery, the new recovery must still give correct results (idempotent)
-   In this algorithm, a large number of transactions need to be redone, because we do not know which data items are already on the disk

Goal: Maximise efficiency during normal operation. However, extra work needs to be done during recovery

Allows maximum flexibility for buffer manager as database outputs are asynchronous, other than having to happen after the corresponding log entries

Most complex at recovery time, because we need to implement both undo and redo

Note: Undo/redo requires a before and after image of the database in the logs, or only after images if an initial image is written to the logs before the first write

## Checkpointing

Speeds up recovery by periodically flushing dirty pages to the disk

1. Output log bufferes to the log
2. Force database buffers to the disk
3. Output an entry `<checkpoint>` to the logs

During recovery

1. Undo all transactions that have not been committed
2. Reddo all transactions that are committed after the checkpoint

# No-Undo/Redo (Deferred DB Modification)

Algorithm

-   Do not output values to disk until commit log entry on stable storage
-   All writes go to logs and database cache
-   Sometimes after commit, cached values are output to disk

Advantages

-   Faster recovery: No undo
-   No before images required

Disadvantages

-   Database outputs must wait
-   Extra work at commit time

# Undo/No-redo

Algorithm

-   All changed data items written to disk before commit
    -   Requires that write entry first be output to stable log
-   At commit
    -   Flush all changed data items in cache
    -   Add commit entry to log

Advantages

-   No after images needed in log
-   No transactions need to be redone

Disadvantages

-   Hot spot data requires flush for each committed write, a lot of IO traffic

# No-Undo/No-Redo

Algorithm

-   No-undo: Do not change database during transaction
-   No-redo: On commit, write changes in a single atomic action

Atomic database writes of many pages accomplished using "shadow paging"

-   Create a new page by copying the old page
-   Change data in the new page
-   Pointer from old page now points to new page

Advantages:

-   Instant recovery
-   No recovery code required

Disadvantages

-   Access to stable storage is indirect
-   Garbage collection of stable storage required
-   Original layout of data destroyed
-   Concurrent transactions are difficult to support

# Pros/Cons

-   Undo/Redo: redo transactions where log has “start” and “commit”, Undo
    transactions where log has “start” but no “commit” - Maximize efficiency during normal operation, some extra work required during recovery, requires before/after information in log
-   No-Undo/Redo: deferrred database modification, i.e., no output on disk until commit log on stable storage
    -   Faster during recovery: no undo, no before information in log, but database outputs must wait, more work at commit time
-   Undo/No-Redo: changes to disk before commit, requires that write entry first be output to (stable) log
    -   No after images are needed in log, no redo, but hot spot data requires a flush for each committed write (lots of I/O traffic)
-   No-Undo/No-Redo: changes only on shadow pages (copies), on commit
    changes written to database in a single atomic action - Recovery instantaneous, nothing to be done, but access to stable storage is indirect, original layout of data destroyed, garbage collection required, and
    concurrent transactions difficult to support

# Strategies for Buffer Pool Management

Steal vs Force

## Policies for Writing Pages to Disk

Steal/No-steal and Force/No-force

Possible ways to flush database cache to database disk

-   Steal: Cache can be flushed before transaction commits
-   No-steal: Cache cannot be flushed before transaction commits
-   Force: Cache is flushed to disk before commit
-   No-force: Cache may be flushed after transaction commits

These correspond to the different ways of handling recovery

-   Steal/No-force: Undo/Redo
-   Steal/Force: Undo/No-redo
-   No-steal/Force: No-undo/Redo
-   No-steal/No-force: No-undo/No-redo

# ARIES Recovery Algorithm

Concrete recovery algorithm used in many database related products

Based on 3 concepts

1. WAL (Write-ahead logging)
    - Inplace updating writes to same original location on disk
        - Most commonly used strategy (avoids shadowing)
    - Maintain "before image" in log, flush to disk before overwritten by "after image" on disk
    - Steal/No-force
2. Repeat history during redo
    - Retrace all actions prior to crash to reconstruct database state up to this point
3. Logging changes during undo
    - Avoids repeating completed undo operations if failure occurs during recovery, which causes a restart of recovery process

## ARIES Log Records

Log consists of records identified by log sequence number (LSN)

-   LSN increases monotonically, indicates disk address of the log record it is associated with
-   In addition, each data page stores LSN of latest log record corresponding to a change in that page

Log record is written for:

-   Data update
-   Transaction commit
-   Transaction abort
-   Undo
-   Transaction end

The event type is recorded as well in the logs

-   In case of an undo, a compensating log record is written

A log record stores

-   Previous LSN of that transaction (`last_lsn`)
    -   Links log records for a single transaction, allowing tracing back of individual transaction among all entries
-   Transaction id (`tran_id`)
-   Type of log record (`type`)

## ARIES Log for Writes

In addition to the above information, for writes specifically, we include

-   Page ID for page including the item
-   Length of updated item
-   Item offset from the beginning of the page
-   Before image (BFIM) of item: Value before modification
-   After image (AFIM) of item: Value after modification

## ARIES Table

Transaction table

-   Contains an entry for each transaction
-   Information such as transaction id, transaction status and LSN of most recent log record of transaction

| Transaction ID | Last LSN | Status      |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1              | 3        | commit      |
| 2              | 2        | in progress |

Dirty page table

-   Contains an entry for each dirty page in the buffer
-   Includes page ID and LSN corresponding to the earliest update to the page

| Page ID | LSN |
| ------- | --- |
| C       | 1   |
| B       | 2   |

## ARIES Checkpointing

Checkpointing

-   Write `begin_checkpoint` record in the log
-   Write `end_checkpoint` record in the log
    -   With this record, the contents of the transaction table and dirty page are appended to the end of the log
-   Write LSN of the `begin_checkpoint` record to a special file
    -   This file is accessed during recovery, to locate the last checkpoint info
-   To reduce the cost of checkpointing, and allow the system to continue to execute transactions, use "fuzzy checkpointing"
    -   DBMS can continue to execute other transactions while checkpointing

## ARIES Recovery

There are multiple phases

1. Analysis phase
    - Start at `begin_checkpoint` record and proceed to the end of the log
    - Access transaction table and dirty page table when encountering `end_checkpoint` record
    - Note that during this phase, other log records can still be written, and transaction table can still be modified
    - Analysis phase compiles the set of undo/redo operations required
        - Identify dirty pages in buffer, and set of active transactions at crash time to determine the appropriate point in the log where redo is to start
2. Redo phase
    - Start from point in the log up to where all the dirty pages are flushed
    - Move forward to the end of the log
        - Any changes that appears in the dirty table is redone
3. Undo phase
    - Start from end of the log, proceed backwards while performing appropriate undos
        - For each undo, write a compensating record to the log

Recovery completes after undo phase

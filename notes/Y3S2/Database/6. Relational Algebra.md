# Relational Algebra

Relation algebra is a basic set of operations for the relational model

- Formal foundations for relational model operations
- Relational algebra expression represents the resulting relation of a database query

# Algebra

Database relations form an algebra with the operators

- Union $\cup$
- Intersection $\cap$
- Difference $\backslash$
- Projection $\pi$
- Renaming $\rho$
- Selection $\sigma$
- Cartesian product $\times$
- Natural join $\bowtie$

A database relation on data set $D$ consists of:

- A schema of attribute names $(a_1, ..., a_n)$
- A finite $n$-ary relation on $D$, which is a subset of $D^n$

## Selection

Specify a subset of tuples that satisfy a condition.

$\sigma_C(R)$ is similar to `SELECT * FROM R WHERE C`

- $C$ is a condition on the attributes of $R$
- Composed of attribute names, comparison operators and values or other attribute names
- Resulting schema is unchanged
- The result is $\{r \ | \ r \in R \land C(r) \}$
- E.g. $\sigma_{\text{type='projector'}}(Rooms)$ return all projectors in every room

## Projection

Specify a subset of attributes

$\pi_{a_1, ..., a_n}(R)$ is similar to `SELECT A1, ..., AN FROM R`

- $R$ is a relation with schema $(a_1, ..., a_n, b_1, ..., b_m)$
- Result is $(a_1, ..., a_n)$
- The result relation is $\{(d_1, ..., d_n) \ | \ (d_1, ..., d_{n+m}) \in R \}$

E.g. $\pi_\text{group, office}(People)$ gets only the group and office attributes from the People relation

## Renaming

$\rho_{S(b_1, ..., b_n)}(R)$ renames relation and attributes, $\rho_S(R)$ renames the relation and $\rho_{(b_1, ..., b_n)}(R)$ renames the attributes

We can also use $\rho_{a \to b}(R)$ to rename a specific attribute $a$ to another name $b$

- $a$ must appear in $a_i$ in the schema of $R$ (Must choose existing attribute)
- $b$ must not appear in the schema of $R$ (Dont rename a variable into another one that already exists)

Similar to `SELECT A AS B FROM TABLE`

$$
\rho_{\text{room $\to$ lokale, capacity $\to$ antal}}(R)
$$

= Renames room to lokale, and capacity to antal

## Cartersian Product

$R \times S$

- Cross product
- If $R$ has schema $(a_1, ..., a_m)$ and $S$ has schema $(b_1, ..., b_n)$, then $R \times S$ has schema $(a_1, ..., a_m, b_1, ..., b_n)$
- The relation is $\{(a_1, ..., a_m, b_1, ..., b_n) \ | \ (a_1, ..., a_m) \in R \land (b_1, ..., b_n) \in S \}$
- Similar to `SELECT * FROM TABLE1, TABLE2`

## Union, Intersection, Difference

$R \cup S$, $R \cap S$, $R \backslash S$

- $R$ and $S$ must have the same schema
- Set operations on $R$ and $S$
- E.g. $\text{Student} \cup \text{Teachers}$, where student and teachers only have the "name" attribute. This lists names of all students and teachers

# Complete Set of Relational Algebra Operators

The set of relational algebra operators $\{\sigma, \pi, \cup, \cap, \backslash, \rho, \times \}$ is complete

- Any relational algebra operation can be described by the above operators
- We introduce new operators for convenience
  - Joins
  - Divisions

## Join

$R \bowtie_C S$

- Combine 2 related relations into a single longer tuple
- 2 relations $R$ and $S$
- A condition $C$ to join them on
- Similar to `SELECT * FROM R CROSS JOIN S WHERE C`
- E.g. $\text{Department} \bowtie_{\text{mgrssn = ssn}} \text{Employee}$ selects all department managers
- $R \bowtie_\theta S \equiv \sigma_\theta(R \times S)$

There are variations to joins

- Equijoin
  - Only $=$ operator used for comparison
  - Always have one or more pairs of attributes with identical values in every tuple
- Natural join
  - Denoted by $*$
  - Remove second superfluous attribute in EQUIJOIN
  - $R * S$

## Division

$R \div S$

- Retrieve the names of all employees who worked on the same projects as "smith": $SSNPNOS \div SMITHPNOS$
- $A \div B = \pi_X(A) - \pi_X((\pi_X(A) \times B) - A)$
- Result schema is (attributes of A – attributes of B)
- Students ÷ Mandatory for Students(name, course) and
  Mandatory(course) yields result schema (name) and returns all tuples that match all entries in Mandatory - Students who have finished all mandatory courses

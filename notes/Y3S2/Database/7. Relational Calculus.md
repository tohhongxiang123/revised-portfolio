# Relational Calculus

Relational calculus is based off first-order predicate calculus. There are 2 forms of calculi

1. Tuple relational calculus (TRC)
2. Domain relational calculus (DRC)

# Tuple Variables and Range Relations

TRC expresses results as sets of tuples that satisfy a condition

-   Make use of tuple variables
-   Range over a particular database relation

A result of all tuples satisfying some condition $P$:

$$
\{ t \ | \ P(t) \}
$$

General expression:

$$
\{ t_1.A_j, t_2.A_k, ..., t_n.A_m \ | \ P(t_1, ..., t_{n+m}) \}
$$

Formula (Boolean condition)

-   Made up of one or more atoms, connected via logical operators
-   Atoms are:
    -   $R(t_i)$: Tuples part of relation $R$ evaluate to true; else false
    -   $t_i.A \text{ op } t_j.B$

# TRC Examples

We have some tables:

-   Customer (CustomerID, Name, Street, City, State)
-   Product(ProductID, Name, Price, Category)
-   Purchased(CustomerID, ProductID, Date)

Listing all dairy products that cost more than $1000: $\{ t \ | \ t.category = \text{'Dairy'} \land t.price > 1000 \}$

Listing all customers' names that have purchased at least 1 product: $\{c.name \ | \ \exist p Purchased(p) \land p.customerID = c.customerID \}$

## Safety

-   Possible to write tuple calculus expressions that generate infinite relations
-   $\{ t \ | \ \neg Employee(t) \}$: All tuples which are not employess (infinitely many)
-   $\{ t \ | \ t [A] = 5 ∨ true \}$: Unsafe, generates infinitely many tuples
-   $\{ t \ | \ t [A] = 5 ∨ t [B]= t [B] \}$: Safe, because it is limited to tuples within the domain

# Domain Relational Calculus

Ranges over single values from domains of attributes. Each query is of the form

$$
\{ x_1, ..., x_n \ | \ P(x_1, ..., x_n) \}
$$

For example

-   List all information about products costing more than $1000: $\{ I, N, P, C \ | \ Product(I, N, P, C) \land P > 1000 \}$
-   List names of all dairy products costing more than $1000: $\{ N \ | \ \exists I \exists P \exists C (Product(I,N,P,C) \land P > 1000) \}$

# Assertions

Assertions are general integrity constraints

-   Expressed directly as predicates which must always be satisfied
-   E.g. No product has a negative price
    -   $\sigma_{price < 0}(Product) = \emptyset$ (Algebra)
    -   $\neg \exists p (Product(p) \land p.price < 0)$ (TRC)
    -   $\neg \exists I,N,P,C (Product(I,N,P,C) \land P < 0)$ (DRC)

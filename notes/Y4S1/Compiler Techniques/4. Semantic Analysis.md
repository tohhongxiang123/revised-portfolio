# Semantic Analysis

Why do we separate syntax analysis from semantic analysis?

-   Semantic rules cannot be expressed with CFGs
-   Separation of concerns
-   To make compiler easier to understand, debug, improve, maintain and extend

Semantic analysis checks whether semantic rules are violated

-   Scoping errors (Variable undeclared, variable declared more than once, etc.)
-   Type inconsistencies (Functions with incorrect parameter types, return expression incorrect type)
-   Etc

Semantic rules depend on the language

# Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

A central data structure for all post-parsing activities like semantic checking, code generation etc

-   Parse trees show the structure of sentences, but they often have redundant information
-   AST catches source program structure and omits unnecessary syntactic details
-   Parser recognises the syntactic structure of the source program, and builds the AST
-   AST should be concise but sufficiently flexible to accomdate the diversity of post-parsing phases

## Parse Trees vs AST

![](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part7/lsbasi_part7_ast_01.png)

-   A parse tree represents a derivation - a conceptual tool for analysing the parsing process
-   An AST is a real data structure that stores information for semantic analysis and code generation

Tree structure

-   Parse tree contains a node for every token in the program
-   Semantically useless symbols and punctuation tokens are omitted in AST

# Design of AST

We devise the AST for grammar to retain the essential information needed for semantic analysis and code generation. For e.g.,

-   Assignment statement
    -   The target of the assignment
    -   The value to be stored at that target
-   If statement
    -   Condition to be tested
    -   Code to run if true
    -   Code to run if false
-   While statement
    -   Loop condition
    -   Loop body

## AST

-   Every node in the AST is labelled with a **node type**
-   Every edge in the AST is labelled by a **child name** that expresses the structural relationship between the parent node and the child node
-   A node that has links to child nodes is a nonterminal node
-   A node with no children will have values such as strings or numbers. These are terminal nodes
-   When a compiler is implemented in an OOP language, each node type is represented by a class. Each edge from a parent to a child node is represented by a field variable in the parent class
-   These classes are called **AST Classes**
-   A number of AST classes may have common structures and behaviors, so a class hierarchy is created where one class can inherit part of all of its strucutre and behaviors from a super/abstract class
    -   E.g. both `AddExpr` and `SubExpr` have left and right operands
-   There may be more than 1 level of super/abstract classes in the hierarchy depending on the sahring of common behaviors among classes
-   Structure of ASTs can be described by an abstract grammar

## Abstract Grammar

-   The translation from abstract grammars to java classes is implemented by the JastAdd tool (Just add to the AST)
-   Abstract grammars can easily be translated into sets of java classes, with every node type represented by one Java class
-   Abstract grammars define sets of trees (ASTs), while context free grammars define sets of sentences
-   An abstract grammar consists of a set of rules. Each rule defines the structure of one class in the hierarchy
-   In abstract grammars, there is only a single rule for each class

Consider the following abstract grammar

```
abstract Expr;
abstract BinExpr: Expr ::= Left : Expr Right: Expr;
AddExpr: BinExpr;
MulExpr: BinExpr;
Literal: Expr ::= <Value: Integer>
```

-   We start with an abstract class `Expr`
-   We define another abstract class `BinExpr`, which has 2 fields: `Left` and `Right`, both of which are `Expr`s as well
-   `AddExpr` and `MulExpr` both inherit from `BinExpr`
-   The format is `<ClassName> ::= [<Fields>]`
-   Abstrract classes are useful to structure inheritance hierarchies and to encapsulate common structures and behaviors of their subclasses
-   Abstract classes do not represent real nodes in an AST

### Generated Java Classes from Abstract Grammar

```java
// abstract Expr;
public abstract class Expr {}

// abstract BinExpr : Expr ::= Left:Expr Right:Expr;
public abstract class BinExpr extends Expr {
    private final Expr Left, Right;

    public BinExpr(Expr Left, Expr Right) {
        this.Left = Left; this.Right = Right;
    }

    public Expr getLeft() { return Left; }
    public Expr getRight() { return Right; }
}

// AddExpr : BinExpr;
public class AddExpr extends BinExpr {
    public AddExpr(Expr Left, Expr Right) {
        super(Left, Right);
    }
}

// MulExpr : BinExpr;
public class MulExpr extends BinExpr {
    public MulExpr(Expr Left, Expr Right) {
        super(Left, Right);
    }
}

public class Literal extends Expr {
    private final Integer Value;
    public Literal(Integer Value) {
        this.Value = Value;
    }

    public Integer getValue() { return Value; }
}
```

-   `BinExpr` inherits from `Expr`
-   `BinExpr` has 2 fields `Left` and `Right` (both are also `Expr`s)
-   Each class has getters for accessing the fields

### Optional Children Nodes

-   Often, some node types in ASTs have an optional child
-   In an abstract grammar, we can express this by bracketing the child: `IfStmt : Stmt ::= Cond:Expr Then:Stmt [Else:Stmt];`
-   The `Opt` class is used by JastAdd to encode optional nonterminal children

```java
public class Opt<T> {
    private final T child;
    // child is present
    public Opt(T child) {
        this.child = child;
    }

    // child is absent
    public Opt() {
        this.child = null;
    }

    public T get() { return child; }
}
```

For the `IfStmt`, we have the following java class

```java
public class IfStmt extends Stmt {
    private final Expr Cond;
    private final Stmt Then;
    private final Opt<Stmt> Else;
    // constructors omitted
    // getCond, getThen omitted
    // check for presence of else branch
    public boolean hasElse() {
        return Else.get() != null;
    }
    public Stmt getElse() {
        return Else.get();
    }
}
```

### List Children Nodes

-   Many nonterminals also may have an arbitrary number of children of the same type. E.g. `BlockStmt`
-   In an abstract grammar, this is encoded as a `list`, which looks like a normal nonterminal child, but suffixed with `*`
-   `BlockStmt : Stmt ::= Stmt*;`
-   This declaration says that a block statement can have 0 or more `Stmt`s

```java
public class BlockStmt extends Stmt {
    private final List<Stmt> stmts;
    public BlockStmt(List<Stmt> stmts) {
        this.stmts = stmts;
    }

    public List<Stmt> getStmts() { return stmts; }

    public Stmt getStmt(int i) {
        return stmts.get(i);
    }

    public int getNumStmt() {
        return stmts.size();
    }
}
```

### Generating ASTs

Once the Java classes for all AST node types have been generated using JastAdd, the parser can call the constructors of the AST classes to construct the AST

-   The semantic actions to create AST nodes will be placed in the grammar (CFG)
-   The actions themselves are surrounded by `{: ` and `:}`, and are placed at the very end of the rule
-   Symbols appearing on the RHS of a CFG rule can be named. The name in a nonterminal symbol is a link to the sub-AST built when the nonterminal is reduced. The name in a terminal symbol is the string value of the token. These names can be used in the semantic actions

Given the CFG:

```
Expr = Expr PLUS Term
    | Term
Term = Term MUL Factor
    | Factor
Factor = NUMBER
    | LPAREN Expr RPAREN
```

The abstract grammar is:

```
abstract Expr;
abstract BinExpr : Expr ::= Left : Expr Right : Expr ;
AddExpr : BinExpr;
MulExpr : BinExpr;
Literal : Expr ::= <Value : Integer> ;
```

And the Beaver specification:

```
%terminals PLUS, MUL, NUMBER, LPAREN, RPAREN;
%goal Expr;
%typeof NUMBER = "String";
%typeof Expr, Term, Factor = "Expr";

Expr = Expr.e PLUS Term.t {: return new AddExpr(e, t); :}
    | Term.t {: return t; :}
    ;

Term = Term.t MUL Factor.f {: return new MulExpr(t, f); :}
    | Factor.f {: return f; :}
    ;

Factor = NUMBER.n {: return new Literal(Integer.parseInt(n)); :}
    | LPAREN Expr.e RPAREN {: return e; :}
    ;
```

-   `%typeof` declares java types for grammar symbols
-   `t` (In `Term.t`) is the AST obtained when CFG rule for `Term` is reduced

### The Parser Builds the AST

Given this specification, Beaver builds a LALR(1) parse table

-   The generated parser uses the parse table to process input tokens as usual
-   Every time the parser performs `reduce()`, it will pop from the steack. Then execute the semantic action associated with the rule. An AST node is returned, which is associated with the LHS of the rule being reduced
-   When the start nonterminal is reduced, the whole AST is built and returned

Lets look at an example for the AST "5 + 4 \* 3"

1. Parser recognises "5" as a `Factor`, and a `reduce` action for `Factor` is done. `Literal` AST is created
    1. Factor is recognized as a `Term`, which is recognised as an `Expr`
    2. The reference to the `Literal` AST is on the stack
2. "+" is recognised as `PLUS`, which is pushed on to the stack
3. Parser recognises "4" as a `Factor`, and a `reduce` action is done: `Literal` AST created
    1. Factor recognised as `Term`
    2. The reference ot the `Literal` AST is on the stack
4. "\*" is recognised as `MUL`, pushed on to the stack
5. "3" recognised as `Factor`, `reduce` performed. `Literal` AST is created. Reference to `Literal` AST is on the stack
6. Parser recognises `Term * Factor` as a `Term`, `reduce` action for `Term` is done
    1. 3 items are popped off the stack. `MulExpr` AST is created, pushed onto the stack
7. Parser recognises `Expr PLUS Term` as `Expr`, `reduce` is perfromed
    1. 3 items are poppped off the stack, and `AddExpr` AST is created, and pushed onto the stack

# Semantic Analysis Using ASTs

There are 2 tasks in semantic analysis

1. Scope checking based on name analysis
2. Type checking based on type analysis

## Performing Computations on ASTs

We will need to perform computations on the AST of a program

-   AST classes need to have additional methods to compute information, like where its declaration is, or what its type is
-   For the compiler builder to define the methods on the AST classes: insert methods into AST classes by JastAdd
    1. Define methods in attribute grammar
    2. Write inter-type methods

### Inter-Type Methods

-   JastAdd offers a langauge feature called **inter-type methods** that is not available in Java
-   An inter-type method is a method of an AST class, but it is defined independently of the class
-   A number of such inter-type methods that logically belong together can be collected together into an **aspect** and placed in a file with the extension `.jrag`
-   An aspect is like a module containing inter-type delcarations (methods and fields) addressing a certain concern for a number of AST classes
-   When JastAdd generates the Java classes corresponding to the node types, it can simply insert the definitions of the inter-type methods into the right AST class
-   The inter-type delcarations are not a java feature, but have to be translated into normal java methods by JastAdd
-   Inter-type methods are discussed later in scope and type checking

### Attribute Grammars

Many computations on ASTs follow common patterns

1. Many analyses need to compute some value for an AST node based on values that were already computed for this node or for the node's children
2. Another pattern is that the value computed for a given node depends on values computed for the node's ancestor node (parent/higher) or even its sibling nodes

-   Coputations following these commonly occurring patterns can be described by attribute grammars
-   An attribute grammar defines a set of attributes on top of an abstract grammar
-   An attribute is simply a function that comptues a value for a certain kind of node

### Synthesised Attributes

-   A synthesised attribute `a` of some node `n` is an attribute whose value is computed based on the attribute values of the children of `n` in the AST and/or some other attributes on `n`
-   Synthesised attributes are a way to pass information from lower level nodes to higher level nodes in an AST
-   Synthesised attributes must be defined for every node type on which it is declared. However, node types inherit attribute definitions from their super types

### Inherited Attributes

-   An inherited attribute `a` of some node `n` is an attribute whose value is computed based on the attribute values of its ancestor nodes (parent or higher) and its siblings in the AST
-   Inherited attributes are a way to pass information from higher level nodes to lower level nodes in an AST

Defining inherited attributes

-   JastAdd supports several abbreviations to make the definition of inherited attributes less verbose
-   If the equations for all children of a certain node type are the same, we can simply define the equation on `getChild`
-   This kind of equation is known as a copy equation, where the value of the inherited attribute of the child is defined to be the same as its value in the parent
-   Like synthesised attributes, inherited attributes are translated by JastAdd into java methods on the generated AST classes
-   Both kinds of attributes are defined in attribute definition files in an aspect with the extension .jrag

### Lazy Attributes

-   If we want to compute attributes for different nodes in the tree, we may end up computing the same attribute for the same node repeatedly
-   If we declare an attribute to be lazy, JastAdd will create and maintain a cached field automatically
-   Such an attribute value will be computed only once, and the result will be stored for future retrieval

### Reference Attributes

-   A reference attribute is an attribute whose value is a reference to some other node in the AST
    -   E.g. an attribute `leftNeighbor` that returns the box immediately to the left of a given box

### Parameterised Attributes

-   Each of the attributes we have seen so far has a single value
-   Some attribute values of an AST node depends on parameters
-   A parameterised attribute will have one value for each possible combination of parameter values

# Name and Type Analysis

-   The goal of name analysis is to determine, for every identifier in the program, which declaration belongs to the indentifier
-   Type analysis computes the types of composite expressions from the types of their components
-   Based on name analysis, scope checking (name checking) can be performed. For example, in java, no 2 fields in the same class should have the same name
-   Based on type analysis, we can perform type checking

## Example Language

Consider the following language

```
Program ::= BlockStmt;
abstract Stmt;

VarDecl : Stmt ::= TypeName <Name:String>;
BlockStmt : Stmt ::= Stmt*;
IfStmt : Stmt ::= Cond:Expr Then:Stmt [Else:Stmt];
WhileStmt : Stmt ::= Cond:Expr Body:Stmt;
ExprStmt : Stmt ::= Expr;

abstract Expr;]

IntLiteral : Expr ::= <Value:Integer>;
BoolLiteral : Expr ::= <Value:Boolean>;
ArrayLiteral : Expr ::= Expr*;

abstract LHSExpr : Expr;
VarName : LHSExpr ::= <Name:String>;
ArrayIndex : LHSExpr ::= Base:Expr Index:Expr;
AssignExpr : Expr ::= Left:LHSExpr Right:Expr;

abstract BinaryExpr : Expr ::= Left:Expr Right:Expr;
AddExpr : BinaryExpr;
MulExpr : BinaryExpr;

abstract TypeName;
Int : TypeName;
Boolean : TypeName;
ArrayTypeName : TypeName ::= ElementType : TypeName;
```

And an example program

```
{
    int x;
    int [][] y;

    y = [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3 ] ];

    { // nested block
        boolean x;
        x = true;

        if (x) {
            y[0][1] = 23 + 2;
        } else {
            y[0][1] = 42;
        }
    }
}
```

### Scoping and Namespaces

-   Like most languages, our language employs a scoping discipline for variables
-   The scope of a variable is the block of statements in which it is declared (including all nested blocks). This is **block scoping**
-   We allow scope nesting: A reference always refers to the innermost variable of that name

-   In our language, variables are the only named entities
-   In some languages such as Java, there are 5 categories of program entities that have names: packages, types, methods, variables, and labels for statements
-   Scopes for packages, types, methods, variables and labels for statements do not interact, and can freely overlap
-   This is often expressed by saying that there are separate namespaces for these 5 kinds of entities

Example of overlapping scope:

```
{ // this is not a program in our example language
    int biggest;
    int biggest(int x, int y)
    {
        return Math.max(x, y);
    }
    biggest = biggest(100, 105);
}
```

The local variable `biggest` and the method `biggest` are in separate namespaces

-   Tranditionally, name analysis in many compilers are implemented using a symbol table
-   A symbol table is a dictionary-like data structure that associates names with information about the declaration they refer to
-   We discuss a different approach: Annotate an AST with semantic information using attributes

### Basic Name Analysis

-   We will define an attribute `decl` on node type
-   `VarName.decl` returns a reference to its `VarDecl` node
-   Or returns `null` if there is no variable of that name in the scope

### Implementing `decl` Attribute in JastAdd

-   For a `VarName` node, we need to locate the `VarDecl` node from higher levels in the AST. Then we need to pass the reference to the `VarDecl` node down to the `VarName` node
-   We define an inherited attribute `lookupVar` for all `Expr` and `Stmt` node types of the AST tree. So `VarName` inherits this attribute
-   The attribute `decl` of a `VarName` needs to get its value from the `lookupVar` attribute of the same `VarName` node. So the `decl` attribute is a synthesised attribute.

```
inh lazy VarDecl Expr.lookupVar(String name); // parameterised attribute
```

### Basic Type Analysis

Type analysis is to determine the type of an expression/method to do type checking

-   We define a synthesised attribute `type` on the node type `Expr` that computes tht etype of an expression node
-   We declare `syn TypeDescriptor Expr.type();`
-   All the subclasses of `Expr` will inherit this attribute
-   We use a new node type called `TypeDescriptor` to annotate the type of an exdpression node. Type descriptors can be defined in the abstract grammar in the .ast file

```
abstract TypeDescriptor;
IntType : TypeDescriptor;
BooleanType : TypeDescriptor;
ArrayType : TypeDescriptor ::= ElementType:TypeDescriptor;
```

-   Each `TypeName` node will be linked to a type descriptor
-   For `Int` and `Boolean` each type has a single instance of the type descriptor: `IntType` or `BooleanType`
-   We let the super class `TypeDescriptor` provide 2 static fields to reference the single instances of `IntType` and `BooleanType`. These are inter-type field declarations made in an aspect in .jrag file

```
syn lazy TypeDescriptorTypeName.getDescriptor();

eq Int.getDescriptor() = TypeDescriptor.INT;
eq Boolean.getDescriptor() = TypeDescriptor.BOOLEAN;
eq ArrayTypeName.getDescriptor() = getElementType().getDescriptor().arrayType();
```

### Type of an Expression

Every expression node needs to compute its type

```
syn TypeDescriptor Expr.type();

eq IntLiteral.type() = TypeDescriptor.INT;
eq BoolLiteral.type() = TypeDescriptor.BOOLEAN;
eq ArrayLiteral.type() = getExpr(0).type().arrayType();
eq VarName.type() = decl().getTypeName().getDescriptor();
eq ArrayIndex.type() = ((ArrayType)getBase().type()).getElementType();
eq AssignExpr.type() = getLeft().type();
eq BinaryExpr.type() = TypeDescriptor.INT;
```

## More Advanced Name and Type Analysis

-   To scale our simple name analysis to a full real-world programming language, several extensions are required
-   Many languages have separate namespaces for variables, types and functions/methods. Hence, we need to define separate lookup attributes for these namespaces, such as `lookupMethod`
-   Another feature of OOP languages that name analysis needs to handle is inheritance. A class has its own fields, together with fields inherited from its super class
-   A number of attributes may be defined in addition to what we have seen so far
-   A synthesised attribute `lookupMemberField` may be defined to first invoke attribute `lookupLocalField` to check whether the field is defined locally
-   If not, it uses attribute `lookupType` to find the declaration of the super class, and recursively invokes `lookupMemberField` on the super class to see if the field is defined there
-   We also need to handle user-defined types, i.e. classes and interfaces. These types are defined by type declaration
-   To determine what type declaration such a type name refers to, we need to implement an attribute `lookupType` to look up a type name from a given point in the AST. Also, we need to define a new kind of type descriptor and link a type name to its type descriptor

## Semantic Error Checking

-   A program may be syntactically well-formed, but still exhibit semantic errors
-   What semantic errors the compiler should check for depends on the language
-   Common semantic errors checked by a compiler include:
    -   Variable used in an expression should be in scope
    -   No 2 fields in the same class should have the same name
    -   Operands and operators should be compatible, etc
-   Semantic error checking is implemented by defining a method `check` for varios nodes in an AST

## Scope Checking

-   Scope checking is performed by the `namecheck()` method on node types `VarDecl` and `VarName`
-   For `VarName`, we simply need to ensure that a declaration of that name is in the scope
-   For `VarDecl`, we want to check that there isn't another variable of the same name declared within the same block
-   To make sure that all `VarName` and `VarDecl` nodes are checked, we traverse the AST systematically, starting from the root of the AST

```
// Program ::= BlockStmt;
public void Program.namecheck() {
    getBlockStmt().namecheck();
}

// BlockStmt : Stmt ::= Stmt*;
public void BlockStmt.namecheck() {
for (Stmt stmt : getStmts())
    stmt.namecheck();
}

// WhileStmt : Stmt ::= Cond:Expr Body:Stmt;
public void WhileStmt.namecheck() {
    getCond().namecheck();
    getBody.namecheck();
}

// VarDecl : Stmt ::= TypeName <Name:String>;
public void VarDecl.namecheck() {
    VarDecl conflicting = lookupVar(getName());
    if (conflicting != null && conflicting.getParent() == this.getParent())
        error("duplicate local variable with name“ + getName());
}

// VarName : LHSExpr ::= <Name:String>;
public void VarName.namecheck() {
    if (decl() == null)
        error("undeclared variable " + getName());
}

// IfStmt : Stmt ::= Cond:Expr Then:Stmt [Else:Stmt];
public void IfStmt.typecheck() {
    getExpr().typecheck();
    getThen().typecheck();

    if (hasElse()) getElse().typecheck();

    if (getExpr().type() != TypeDescriptor.BOOLEAN)
        error("if condition must be boolean");
}

// WhileStmt : Stmt ::= Cond:Expr Body:Stmt;
public void WhileStmt.typecheck() {
    getExpr().typecheck();
    getBody().typecheck();

    if (getExpr().type() != TypeDescriptor.BOOLEAN)
        error("loop condition must be boolean");
}

// ExprStmt : Stmt ::= Expr;
public void ExprStmt.typecheck() {
    getExpr().typecheck();
}

// IntLiteral : Expr ::= <Value:Integer>;
public void IntLiteral.typecheck() { }
// typecheck() for BooleanLiteral and VarName will also have
// nothing to do

// AssignExpr : Expr ::= Left:LHSExpr Right:Expr;
public void AssignExpr.typecheck() {
    getLeft().typecheck();
    getRight().typecheck();
    if (getRight().type() != getLeft().type())
        error("LHS and RHS types do not match");
}

// abstract BinaryExpr : Expr ::= Left:Expr Right:Expr;
public void BinaryExpr.typecheck() {
    getLeft().typecheck();
    getRight().typecheck();

    if (getLeft().type() != TypeDescriptor.INT || getRight().type() != TypeDescriptor.INT)
        error("both operands must be integers");
}

// ArrayLiteral : Expr ::= Expr*;
public void ArrayLiteral.typecheck() {
    for (Expr expr : getExprs())
        expr.typecheck();

    if (getNumExpr() == 0) { // forbid empty array literals
        error("empty array literals not allowed");
    } else { // all expressions should have the same type
        TypeDescriptor tp = getExpr(0).type();
        for (int i = 1; i < getNumExpr(); ++i)
            if !EqualType(getExpr(i).type(), tp)
                error("inconsistent types");
    }
}

// ArrayIndex : LHSExpr ::= Base:Expr Index:Expr;
public void ArrayIndex.typecheck() {
    // first recursively check the base and the index
    getBase().typecheck();
    getIndex().typecheck();

    // ensure that the base expression’s type is an array type
    if (!(getBase().type() instanceof ArrayTypeDescriptor))
        error("array index base must be an array");

    // ensure that the index expression has type int
    if (getIndex().type() != TypeDescriptor.INT)
        error("array index must be numeric");
}
```

-   In the error checking for statements, we start from the root node of the AST, and recursively check their child statements and expressions
-   We do type checking

# Summary

-   .ast files contains the abstract grammar to define all the node types in the AST, including type descriptors
-   .jrag files contain
    -   Attribute grammar to define all attributes
    -   All inter-type declarations, including inter-type field declarations and inter-type method declarations (e.g. all `namecheck` and `typecheck` methods)
-   It is better to group inter-type declarations and attribute grammars that logically belong together in one aspect in one .jrag file
-   The attribute grammar and inter-type declarations have defined all methods required for semantic analysis
-   The top level code for a semantic analyser
    -   First, call `Program.namecheck()` to do scope checking
    -   Second, call `Program.typecheck()` to do type checking
-   If there is no error, we start code generation

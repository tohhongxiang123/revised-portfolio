# Introduction

Computer security

- Allow intended use of computer systems
- Prevent unwanted use that may cause harms

# Attack Motivation

Financial Profit

- Steal personal data and sell it to the black market
- Steal credit card information or bank accounts
- Ransomware: Inject malicious software into a system, encrypt the data and request for ransom

# Computer System Security

Provide a protected environment for data and its processing

- Physical security
- Process protection
- Data protection
- User authentication
- Communication protection

# System Security Failures

- Cryptographic algorithms can be broken
- Security features are not designed properly
- Security features are not used correctly
- Security components are not implemented correctly
- Security components are not configured properly
- Security is not managed properly
- Threat environment may change, and assumptions become invalid

# Basics of Computer Security

## Trust

The degree to which an entity is expected to behave

- What the entity is **expected to do**: anti-malware programs detecting malicious programs, systems preventing illegal logins
- What the entity is **expected not to do**: Website will not expose your private details, applications will not inject viruses into your system, etc.

Security cannot be established in a computer system if no entities are trusted

It is important to define what should be trusted. Otherwise, the designed security solutions may fail in practice.

## Trusted Computing Base (TCB)

A set of system components (e.g. software, OS, firmware, hardware) that needs to be trusted to ensure the security of the computer system

Components outside the TCB can be malicious and misbehave

When designing a security system, we need to

- Assume all components in the TCB are secure with valid justifications
- Prevent any damages from any components outside the TCB

Size of TCB

- The smaller the number of components in the TCB, the more trustworthy the system is (less assumptions to be made, less likely for assumptions to be violated)
- Design a secure system with a smaller TCB is more challenging (we need to consider more malicious entities)

## Threat Model

Describe the adversaries in consideration

- What can be trusted, what cannot be trusted
- For untrusted entities, what resources, capabilities and knowledge they have, and what actions they can perform
- What security properties the system aims to achieve

For example, a phishing email (malicious email with malware as the attachment)

- What is trusted: Hardware and OS
- What is not trusted: Email attachment
- Adverserial capabilities: Running malicious code on the computer
- Security properties: Protect the computer system such that malware cannot steal the sensitive data, or tamper with other processes

## Security Properties

Security goals we aim to achieve for the system

Common security properties: CIA model

1. Confidentiality: **Prevent unauthorised disclosure** of information. Sensitive information should not be leaked to unauthorised parties
2. Integrity: **Prevent unauthorised modification** of information. Critical system states and code cannot be altered by malicious parties
3. Availability: **Prevent unauthorised withholding** of information/resources. The resources/information should always be available for authorised users

Other properties: 4. Accountability: Actions of any entity can be traced and identified 5. Non-repudiation: Unforgeable evidencec that specific actions occurred 6. Authenticity: Ensure that the communicated entity is the correct entity

## Security Strategies

1. Prevention: Take measures to prevent system from being damaged
2. Detection: Take measures to detect when/how/by whom your system has been damaged by
3. Reaction: Take measures so that you can recover your any damage to your system

## Design Principles for Computer Security

1. Principle of least privilege
   - Entity should be given **minimal permissions** to complete its task
   - Give the privilege when needed, and revoke the privilege after use
   - If granting unnecessary permissions, malicious entities can abuse those permissions to perform an attack
2. Principle of separation of privilege
   - Separation of duty: For multiple entities working together, it is better to distribute privileges to different entities
   - A single malicious party cannot get all required privileges to perform an attack
3. Defense in depth
   - Multiple types of defenses should be layered together
   - Increase difficulty of attacking entire system

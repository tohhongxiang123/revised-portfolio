# Cryptography

Cryptography is the science and math of scrambling data (using specific methods with a "key") into meaningless gibberish, to render data incomprehensible to eavesdroppers

# Caesar Cipher

- Shift letters by a constant amount
- E.g. `I LIKE U` with a shift of 3 forward: `L OLNH X`
- Easy to break
- To make cipher harder, use all possible shifts (25 possible shifts)
- Simplest mono-alphabetic cipher (each letter maps uniquely to 1 other letter, 1-1 match)
- However, only 25 possible keys (trivial for computers to break)

## How Big should Key Space be

- Depends on who you are guarding against
- 3 GHz PC can crack a key space of roughly $2^{34}$ in 1 day
  - A 3GHz PC can perform $3 \times 10^9$ operations per second, which means $2 \times 10^{14}$ operations a day
  - $2^{34} \approx 1.7 \times 10^{10}$
- Present day security requires minimum $2^{128}$ bit security

# Crypto Terminology

- Cryptology: Art and science of making/breaking secret codes
- Cryptography: Making secret codes
- Cryptanalysis: Breaking secret codes
- Crypto: All of the above

- A **cipher**/**cryptosystem** used to encrypt **plaintext**
- Result of encryption is **ciphertext**
- Decrypt ciphertext to obtain **plaintext**
- **Key** is used to configure a cryptosystem
- A symmetric key cryptosystem uses the same key to encrypt/decrypt
- A public key cryptosystem uses a public key to encrypt, and a private key to decrypt

# Caesar Cipher (Simple Substitution)

Shift all letters by a key (which is a number from 1-25)

- Ciphertext `VSRQJHEREVTXDUHSDQWV`
- If this was a shift-by-3, we unshift by 3 and get `SPONGEBOBSQUAREPANTS`

Instead of shifting all letters by 3, we can scramble the 26 letters A-Z into other permutations of A-Z

- $26!$ possible permutations
- Encrypt accordingly based on scrambled key
- Decrypt using same scrambled key

In general, simple substitution key can be any permutation of letters

- Not necessarily just a constant shift of alphabet

```
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
J I C A X S E Y V D K W B Q T Z R H F M P N U L G O
```

- Now $26!$ possible keys

Now, for a given ciphertext, we know that a simple substitution is used, but not necessarily a shift-by-n.

- We can be more clever by considering the distribution of each english letter in a text
- Vowels are more likely to be used (E being the most common)
- Use ciphertext distribution to find a likely mapping based on frequencies

## Cryptanalysis Terminology

- Cryptosystem is secure if the best known attack is to try all keys (brute force)
- Cryptosystem is broken if any attack without trying all keys can be used to break the system
- Although substitution has $26!$ possible keys, it can be broken with frequency analysis
- Main weakness: Letters in english are unevenly distributed
- Hence, never use substitution ciphers

# Vignere Cipher

Letters are not substituted/shifted by a constant, rather the letters are shifted by a value defined in the key

- Key `DUH`, letters are shifted by 3, 20, 7
  - `D` is 3 letters after `A`
  - `U` is 20 letters after `A`
  - `H` is 7 letters after `A`
- This 3,20,7 pattern repeats until end of plaintext

Using `DUH` as the key, `CRYPTO` is encrypted into `FLFSNV`

- `C` shifted by 3
- `R` shifted by 20
- `Y` shifted by 7
- `P` shifted by 3
- etc

We can see that in this cipher, the same letter can be mapped to different letters, and different letters can be mapped to the same letter

- This is known as **poly-alphabetic** substitution, which is more secure than mono-alphabetic substitution

Breaking vignere:

- Consider `THEYDRINKTHETEA` encrypted into `WBLBXYLHRWBLWYH`
- First step: Figuring out key length
- Notice that `WBL` appears twice, at 9-letter interval
- This suggests that a 3-letter word was encrypted twice using the same shift values
- We can deduce that the key's length is 9, or a factor of 9
- Furthermore, we can guess that this repeated 3-letter word is `THE`, and determine that `DUH` was used as the encryption key

Note: Long keywords and shorter messages implies stronger Vigenere cipher, not good enough for modern use

# One-Time Pad

- A classical cipher (like the vignere or caesar cipher) cannot be secure unless it comes with a huge key, but encryption with a huge key is impractical
- However, one-time pad is the most secure version
- Guarantees perfect secrecy: Even if attacker has unlimited computing power, impossible to learn anything about plaintext except for its length

OTP takes a plaintext $P$, and a random key $K$ which is the same length as $P$, and produces a ciphertext $C = P \oplus K$

- $C, P, K$ are all bit strings of the same length, and $\oplus$ is the bitwise XOR

To decrypt, we use $K$ again, and XOR it with the cipher

$$
\begin{aligned}
C &= P \oplus K \\
C \oplus K &= P \oplus K \oplus K \\
&= P \oplus 0 \\
&= P
\end{aligned}
$$

- XOR is instantaneous, hence fast encryption/decryption

Using one-time-pad for letters:

- Use a long random pad which is the same length as the plaintext
  - Random pad was generated previously, and randomly (uniformly distributed in the set of all possible keys, independent of plaintext)
- Suppose plaintext is `YES`, with pad `CAB`
- `YES` + `CAB` = `BFU` (`Y` shifted by `C`, `E` shifted by `A`, `S` shifted by `B`)
- If user receives cipher text `BFU` and knows that the key is `CAB`, we just reverse the encryption process to get `YES`
  - Encryption was a right-shift, hence decryption is a left-shift
  - If an attacker does not know the key, all possible keys are and their corresponding decryptions are equally likely

Note that for one-time-pad

- Pad must be random
- Pad must be used only once
- Keep track of bits used
- Pad is only known by sender and receiver
- Pad key must be the same length as the plaintext

# Challenges of OTP

- How to generate truly random long OTP?
- How to store OTP securely?
- How to encrypt/decrypt securely?
- Both parties have to keep in synchronisation portions of the pad that has already been used, so that both can keep talking
- How to agree on new OTP if old OTP is used up or compromised?

## Notations

Suppose $X_i$ is bit $i$ of OTP

- Random OTP informally means:
  - $P(X_i = 0) = P(X_i = 1) = 0.5$
  - Successive bits are independent of each other: $P(X*{i+1} | X_i) = P(X*{i + 1})

Randomness

- Without randomness, cryptography would be impossible because all operations would become predictable and therefore insecure
- Mistaking randomness for non-randomness: Thinking that patterns appearing by chance are there for a reason
- Mistaking non-randomness for randomness: Thinking object was randomly generated simply because it looks random
- In crypto, non-randomness is often synonymous with insecurity
- Crypto notion of randomness needs to be much more stringent than randomness in simulations (monte-carlo) used in videogames, or computing probabilities

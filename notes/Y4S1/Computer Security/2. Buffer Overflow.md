# Buffer Overflow

# Basic Concepts in Software Security

- Vulnerability: A weakness which allows attackers to reduce a system's information assurace
- Exploit: A technique that takes advantage of a vulnerability, used by the attacker to attack the system
- Payload: Custom code that the attacker wants the system to execute

# Significance of Vulnerabilities

- Increased vulnerabilities per year as software complexity increases
- Common in various platforms
- Takes longer time to remediate
- Huge financial and business costs

# Types of Vulnerabilities

Memory safety violations

- Buffer overflows and overreads
- Dangling pointers

Input validation errors

- Format string attacks
- SQL injection
- Code injection
- Cross-site scripting in web applications

Race conditions

- Time-of-check-to-time-of-use bugs
- Symlink races

Privilege confusion bugs

- Cross-site request forgery
- Clickjacking
- FTP bounce attacks

Privilege escalation

Timing attacks

# Different Kinds of Malware

- Adware
  - Displays unwanted advertisements
- Ransomware
  - Block user's data until a ransom is paid
- Spyware
  - Gather information about a user, and send it to the attacker
- Crimeware
  - Designed specifically to automate cybercrime
- Worms
  - Propagate to different computers without user intervention
- Viruses
  - Propagates to different computers, but needs to be triggered by users
- Trojans
  - Pretends to be something useful, but masks malicious behaviors
- Rootkits
  - Obtains root user privileges to compromise a user's computer
- Backdoor
  - Allow a remote party to gain access to the computer

# Why Softwares have Vulnerabilities?

- Programs are developed by humans, and humans make mistakes
- Programmers are not security-aware
- Programming languages are not well-designed for security
- Software bugs are bad with potential serious consequences
- An intelligent adversary wishes to exploit them
  - Lead bugs to the worst possible consequence
  - Select their targets

# Memory Layout of a Program

![](https://open4tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Memory_model.jpg)

- Code area: Fixed size, read only
- Static data: Statically allocated data, consists of variables/constants
- Stack: Parameters and local variables of methods as they are invoked
  - Each invocation of a method creates a **frame** (activation record) which is pushed onto the stack
- Heap: Dynamically allocated data
  - Class instances, data array
- Stack and heap grows towards each other

# Stack

Stores local variables (including method parameters) and intermediate computation results

A stack is divided into multiple frames

- A method is invoked: New frame is pushed onto the stack to store local variables and intermediate results for this method
- A method exits: Its frame is popped off, exposing the frame of the caller beneath it

## Inside a Frame for a Single Function

![](https://www.codeproject.com/KB/mcpp/5256936/stack.png)

2 pointers

- BP: Base pointer, fixed at frame base
- SP: Stack pointer, current pointer in frame

Each frame consists of the following parts

- Function parameters
- Return address of caller function
  - When function is complete, execution continues at this return address
- Stack pointer of caller function
- Local variables
- Intermediate operands
  - Dynamically grows/shrinks

# Buffer Overflow

Definition: More input is placed into the buffer than its allocated capacity, overwriting other information

- If buffer is on stack/heap/global data, overwriting adjacent memory could cause
  - Corruption of program data
  - Unexpected transfer of control
  - Memory access violation
  - Execution of code chosen by attacker

## Basic Idea

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void foo(char *s) {
    char buf[12];
    strcpy(buf,s); // strcpy does not check boundaries
    printf("buf is %s\n",buf);
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    foo("Buffer-Overflow!");
    return 0;
}
```

In addition to `strcpy`, there are other vulnerable functions: `strcat`, `get`, `scanf`, and many more

## Exploit

![](https://3762986563-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-M5spcVnZfIHxfePpMzK%2F-M5sphYdfgyXfsRA7x6D%2F-M5sphyyt2U-0esLkjGZ%2Fimage1.png?generation=1587944025477422&alt=media)

Stack smashing

1. Inject malicious code into memory of target program
2. Find a buffer on the runtime stack of the program, and overwrite the return address with a malicious buffer
3. When function is completed, it jumps to the malicious address instead, and runs the malicious code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void overflow(const char* input) {
    char buf[256];
    printf("Virtual address of 'buf' = Ox%p\n", buf);
    strcpy(buf,input);
}

void attack() {
    printf("'attack’ is called without explicitly invocation.\n");
    printf("Buffer Overflow attack succeeded!\n");
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    printf("Virtual address of 'overflow' = Ox%p\n",overflow);
    printf("Virtual address of 'attack' = Ox%p\n", attack);
    char input[] = "…"; /* useless content as offset*/
    char add[] = "\xf9\x51\x55\x55\x55\x55"; /* attack address*/
    strcat(input, add);
    overflow(input);
    return 0;
}
```

How to set the malicious return address?

- Need absolute address of malicious code, which is infeasible
- Guess return address
- Incorrect address can cause system crash
  - Unmapped address, protected kernel code, data segmentation

Improve guess chance

- Insert many NOP instructions before malicious code
- This increases the surface area of the malicious code, so that guessed address is more likely to run malicious code

## Injecting Shellcode

The worst thing an attacker can do

- Run any command he wants
- Run a shellcode: A program whose only goal is to launch a shell
- Convert shellcode from C to assembly code, and store binary to a buffer

# Example Buffer Overflow Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

char CheckPassword() {
    char good = 'N';
    char Password[5];
    gets(Password);
    return good;
}
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    printf("Enter your password:");
    if(CheckPassword() == 'Y')
        printf("Your random number is %d\n", 66);
    else{
        printf("You don't have the permission to get a random number");
        exit(-1);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The user should never have the permission to get his random number. However, if we use a password with length at least 6 (`YYYYYY`), we can override `good` with `'Y'` and get permission.

- Note that `gets` has been deprecated in > C11 because it is insecure.
- Using some online browsers, they can detect stack smashing and terminate the program early

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int check_authentication(char *pwd) {
    int auth_flag = 0;
    char Password[] = "qwertyu";
    char buffer[8];
    strcpy(buffer, pwd);
    if (strncmp(buffer, Password, 8) == 0)
      auth_flag = 1;
    return auth_flag;
}
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    if(check_authentication(argv[1]))
        printf("Access Granted\n");
    else {
        printf("Access Denied\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Similar to above, if we use a password such as `"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"` (16 a's), we can overwrite the `Password` variable

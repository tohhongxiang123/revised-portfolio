# Memory Safety Vulnerabilities

# Format String Vulnerabilities

`printf`: Prints a formatted string to standard output

-   A formatted string is a string with special format specifiers (escape sequences prefixed with `%`)\
-   `printf` can take more than 1 argument: The first argument is the format string, the rest consist of values to be substituted for the format specifiers

```c
printf("Hello %d\n", 2014);
printf("The value of pi is %f\n", 3.14);
```

Consider the following example program:

```c
// Online C compiler to run C program online
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int get_secret() {
    return 69420;
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    int uid1 = 0x12345;
    int secret = get_secret();
    int uid2 = 0x56789;
    char str[255];
    if (argc < 2)
        return 1;

    strncpy(str, argv[1], 255);
    str[255] = '\0';

    printf("Welcome");
    printf(str);

    return 0;
}
```

This program has a string format vulnerability on the line `printf(str)`. Consider passing the string `%d.%d.%d.%d.%d.%d.%d.%d.%d.%d.` to `main`

-   `printf` will run thinking that `str` is a format string, and since there are no remaining arguments, it will start printing from the stack
-   `Welcome696074912.0.690212875.0.696074912.1792175224.0.0.69420.623797285.778315054`
-   We can see that `secret` is within the printed debug string

# A Main Source of Security Problems

Escape sequences are essentially instructions

-   Attacks work by injecting escape sequences into format strings

A vulnerable program

-   Attackers control both escape sequences and arguments in `user_input`
-   Number of arguments should match the number of escape sequences in the string
-   Mismatch can cause vulnerabilities
-   C compiler is unable to check mismatches

## Attack 1: Leak Vulnerable Information from Stack

```c
printf("%d %d %d\n", x, y);
```

-   3 arguments for the format string
-   However only 2 arguments passed in
-   Stack does not realize that an argument is missing, and will retrieve unauthorised data from the stack to print
-   Hence, data is leaked to the attacker

A neat way to print out the stack contents: `printf("%08x %08x %08x %08x %08x");`

## Attack 2: Crash the Program

Correct function: `printf("%s", "Hello world");`

Incorrect function: `printf("%s")`

-   Stack does not realize an argument is missing, and will retrieve data from the stack to print out data
-   This address can be invalidated, and the program will crash
    -   No physical address has been assigned to such address
    -   Address is protected (kernel memory)

Increase the probability of crashing by adding more specifiers: `printf("%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s%s");`

## Attack 3: Modify Memory

Correct function: `printf("13579%n", &i);`

-   store the number of characters written so far (5) into an integer pointed by `i`

Incorrect function: `printf("13579%n);`

-   Stack does not realize an argument is missing, and retrieve data from the stack, and overwrite it
-   Attackers can achieve:
    -   Overwrite important program flags that control access privilege
    -   Overwrite return addresses on the stack, function pointers etc

## How to Fix Format String Vulnerabilities

Limit adversaries' ability to control the format string

-   Use hard-coded format strings
-   Do not use `%n`
-   Compiler support to match `printf` arguments with format string

# Integer Overflow Vulnerabilities

In computers, integers are represented in binary

-   Binary string of a fixed length
-   Signed integers can be represented using 2's complement
    -   MSB indicates the sign of the integer
    -   MSB 0: Positive, MSB 1: Negative

## Two's Complement

Positive numbers:

-   MSB = 0
-   Remaining digits are in normal binary representation

Negative numbers:

-   MSB = 1
-   From the normal positive number's binary representation, flip all the bits, then add 1

Conversion from positive to negative numbers

-   Take binary representation
-   Flip all the bits
-   Add 1

-1 -(To binary)-> 0000 0001 -(Flip)-> 1111 1110 -(Add 1)-> 1111 1111
-128 -(To binary)-> 1000 0000 -(Flip)-> 0111 1111 -(Add 1)-> 1000 0000

## Integer Overflow

An integer is increased over its maximal value, or decreased below its minimal value

-   Unsigned overflow: Binary representation cannot represent the integer value
-   Signed overflow: MSB is flipped

Integer overflow is difficult to spot, and could lead to other types of bugs such as buffer overflow

## Arithmetic Overflow

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    unsigned int u1 = UINT_MAX; // 4,294,967,295
    u1++;
    printf("u1 = %u\n", u1); // 0

    unsigned int u2 = 0;
    u2--;
    printf("u2 = %u\n", u2); // 4,294,967,295

    signed int s1 = INT_MAX; // 2,147,483,647
    s1++;
    printf("s1 = %d\n", s1); // -2,147,483,648

    signed int s2 = INT_MIN; // -2,147,483,648
    s2--;
    printf("s2 = %d\n", s2); // 2,147,483,647
}
```

## Widthness Overflow

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    unsigned int l = 0xdeabeef;
    printf("l = 0x%u\n", l);

    unsigned short s = l;
    printf("s = 0x%u\n", s); // 0xbeef

    unsigned char c = l;
    printf("c = 0x%u\n", c); // 0xef
}
```

## Example 1: Bypass Length Checking

OS Kernel system-call handler checks string lengths to defend against buffer overruns

```c
char buf[128];
combine(char *s1, unsigned int len1, char *s2, unsigned int len2) {
    if (len1 + len2 + 1 <= sizeof(buf)) {
        strncpy(buf, s1, len1);
        strncat(buf, s2, len2);
    }
}
```

The following conditions will pass checking: `len1 < sizeof(buf) && len2 = UINT_MAX`

-   `len2 + 1 = 0`, so `strncpy` and `strncat` will still be executed

A better length check:

```c
if (len1 <= sizeof(buf) && len2 <= sizeof(buf) && (len1 + len2 + 1 <= sizeof(buf)))
```

-   Ensures that no integer overflow will occur

## Example 2: Writing at Wrong Memory Location

Consider an array starting at location 0xBBBB (on a 16-bit machine)

We write to element at index 0xC455

-   0xBBBB + 0xC455 = 0x8000 (Overflowed)

The memory location at 0x8000 is overwritten. We must check lower bounds for array indices

## Example 3: Truncation Errors

A bad type conversion can cause integer overflows:

```c
int func(char *name, long cbBuf) {
    unsigned int bufSize = cbBuf;
    char *buf = (char *)malloc(bufSize);
    if (buf) {
        memcpy(buf, name, cbBuf);
        // ...
        free(buf);
        return 0;
    }
}
```

A buffer overflow in `memcpy` will occur if `cbBuf` is larger than $2^{32} - 1$

-   Note that `long` is 8 bytes (32 bits)

## Example 4: Signed and Unsigned Vulnerability

```c
int func(char *data, int len) {
    char *buf = (char *)malloc(64);
    if (len > 64)
        return 0;

    memcpy(buf, data, len);
}
```

-   `int` is signed, while `memcpy` only accepts unsigned integers (`void *memcpy(void *dest, const void * src, size_t n)`)
-   `memcpy` will convert `len` from `int` (signed integer) to `size_t` (unsigned integer)
-   If `len == -1`, it will be converted to `0xFFFFFFFF`, causing buffer overflow

# Scripting Vulnerabilities

## Scripting Languages

-   Construct scripts from predefined code fragments and user input at runtime
-   Script is passed to another software component where it is executed
-   Scripting languages are viewed as a domain-specific language for a particular environment
-   E.g. Bash, Powershell, Python...

Vulnerabilities

-   An attacker can hide additional commands in the user input
-   System will execute malicious commands without any awareness

## Example: CGI Script

Common Gateway Interface (CGI)

-   Defines a standard way in which information can be passed between browser and server

Consider a server running the following command:

```
cat $file | mail $clientaddress
```

-   `$file` and `$clientaddress` are provided by the client

Normal case:

-   A client sets `$file=hello.txt`, and `$clientaddress=127.0.0.1`

Compromised user input:

-   The attacker set `$file=hello.txt` and `$clientaddress=127.0.0.1 | rm -rf /`
-   Now the command becomes `cat $file | mail 127.0.0.1 | rm -rf /`
-   After mailing the file, all files that the script has permission to delete are deleted

## Structured Query Language (SQL)

A domain-specific language used for databases, particularly useful for handling structured data. E.g.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE username='Alice';
INSERT INTO Accounts (Username, Password) VALUES ('Alice', '1234');
UPDATE Accounts SET Password='hello' WHERE Username= 'Alice';
```

## SQL Injection

Consider the following SQL command:

```sql
SELECT * FROM client WHERE name= $name;
```

-   User has to provide `$name`

Compromised input:

-   The attacker sets `$name = 'Bob' OR 1=1`
-   The query now becomes:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM client WHERE name='Bob' OR 1=1;
    ```
-   Since `1=1` is always true, the entire database is selected, and the attacker can see all information, violating confidentiality

## Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

Targets web applications

-   Some websites may require users to provide an input for searching
-   A malicious user may encode executable content in the input, which can be echoed back in a webpage
-   A victim user later visits the webpage, and the browser may execute the malicious commands on his computer
-   E.g. [Self-retweeting tweet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv0kZKC6GAM)
-   ![](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-11-at-9.45.29-AM.jpg)

## Stored XSS (Persistent)

Attack steps

-   Attacker discovers XSS vulnerability in a website
-   Attacker embeds malicious commands inside the input and sends it to the website
-   Now the command has been injected into the website
-   A victim browses the website, and malicious code will run on the visitor's computer

## Reflected XSS (Non-persistent)

-   Attacker discovers XSS vulnerability in a website
-   The attacker creates a malicious link with malicious commands inside
-   Attacker distributes link to victims, e.g. via emails
-   Victim clicks the link, which activates the malicious commands

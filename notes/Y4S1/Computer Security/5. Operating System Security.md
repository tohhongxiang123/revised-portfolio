# Operating System Security

# OS Becomes More Complex

From single-user to multi-user

-   DOS is truly single user
-   MacOS, Linux, Windows are multi-user, but typically only 1 user in PCs
-   Cloud computing allows multiple users all over the world to run on the same OS, and they do not know each other
-   Tradeoff of efficiency vs security

From trusted apps to untrusted apps

-   Simple real-time systems only run 1 specific app
-   Runs verified apps from trusted parties
-   Modern PCs and smartphones run apps from third-party developers
-   Tradeoff of functionality vs security

# Complex OS Brings More Challenges

Protecting a single computer with 1 user is easy

-   Prevent everybody else from having access
-   Encrypt all data with a key only one person knows

Sharing resources safely is hard

-   Preventing some people from reading private data (e.g. medical records, employee information etc)
-   Prevent some people from using too many resources (disk space, CPU etc)
-   Prevent some people from interfering with other programs (inserting keystrokes, modifying displays etc)

# OS Responsibilities

| Functionalities                     | Security goals                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Support multiple concurrent users   | Protect users from each other         |
| Manage multiple apps concurrently   | Protect apps from each other          |
| Connect to network                  | Protect system from untrusted network |
| Sharing data with different domains | Secure data sharing                   |

# What's Being Protected? Resources

System is secure if resources are used and accessed as intended under all circumstances

# Privileged Rings Inside OS

Operating Modes

-   Kernel mode has highest privileges, running critical functions and services
-   Entities with higher privilege levels cannot call functions and access objects in lower privilege levels directly
    -   System calls, interrupts etc
-   Status flags allow system to work in different modes (context switching)

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Priv_rings.svg/1200px-Priv_rings.svg.png)

# Interrupt

Context switch

-   The userlevel process generates a trap, which incurs an interrupt
-   CPU stores process's states, and switches to kernel mode by setting status flag
-   Kernel handles interrupt based on trap address (interrupt vector) in an interrupt table
-   CPU switches back to the user mode, and restores states

# Process Security

A program in execution, consisting of executable code, data and execution content (contents of certain CPU registers)

Process isolation

-   Each process has its own address space
-   Logical separation of processes as a basis for security: an independent process cannot affect or be affected by the execution of other processes

Process communication

-   A cooperating process can affect, or be affected by the execution of other processes
-   Such processes have to communicate with each other to share data (Inter-process communication)
-   A context switch between processes can be an expensive and insecure operation

# Memory Management

Memory layout

-   Each process is allocated a segment of memory for storing data and computation results
-   Memory scope is restricted by `Base` and `Limit`
-   Divided into memory pages of equal length
-   A process is not allowed to access memory pages not belonging to it
    -   OS checks if each memory access is allowed
    -   Page fault occurs if a memory access is illegal

# Security Protection from OS

The OS is responsible for protecting the apps running on it

-   OS controls what users/processes can do
    -   Identification and authentication
    -   Authorisation (Access control)
    -   Accountability (Logging and Auditing)

## Identification and Authentication

How does a computer know if I am the correct user?

-   What you know? Password, PIN, public/private keys
-   What you have? Smartcard, hardware tokens
-   Who you are? Biometrics, face recognition, voice recognition

How does system conduct authentication?

-   Compare input credential with stored one
-   Allow entry when credential matches

## Access Control

Principle of least privilege

-   Users should only have access to resources needed to perform desired tasks
-   Too much privilege allows a malicious user to conduct unintended activites

Privilege separation

-   Split a system into different components, and each component is assigned with the least privilege required for its tasks
-   Limiting the privilege can prevent any attacker from taking over the entire system

## Security Policy

Specify (Subject, Object, Operation) triples

-   Subject
    -   Acting system principals
    -   User, program, process...
-   Object
    -   Protected resources
    -   File, memory devices
-   Operation
    -   How subject operates on objects
    -   Read/write/execute/delete

## Access Control Policy

Who sets policy?

-   Users with some system restrictions

Access Control Matrix (ACM)

-   Each column represents an object
-   Each row represents a subject
-   Entry shows the allowed verbs

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aFdE_5CfLU4/maxresdefault.jpg)

How is policy enforced?

-   OS exposes API to apps, with privileged operations
-   Checks access control matrix when API functions are called

## Update Access Control Matrix

Access Control Changes

-   Grant capabilties: The owner of the object can grant rights to other useres
-   Revoke capabilities: Subjects can revoke the rights from others

Six commands to alter access matrix

1. Create subject s: Create a new subject s
2. Create object o: Creates a new object o
3. Enter r into Ms, o: Addrs right r to cell Ms, o
4. Delete r from Ms, o: Deletes right r from cell Ms, o
5. Destroy subject s: Deletes subject s. The column and row for s in M are also deleted
6. Destroy object o: Deletes object o. The column for o in M is also deleted

## More Representations

Access Control Lists (ACLs)

-   For one object, which subject has accesses to it? (Check column in ACM)

Capability

-   For one subject, which objects it has capability to access? (Check rows in ACM)

Most system use both

-   ACLs for opening an object, e.g. `fopen()`
-   Capabilities for performing operations, e.g. `read()`

## Data Sharing

Problem: Multiple users want to access the same file/data

-   Give each user the corresponding permissions
-   When a new user joins, permissions have to be granted again
-   When permissions are changed, need to alter each user

Solution: Group

-   Set permissions for the group instead of the user
-   A user joining the group will have the corresponding permissions
-   A user quitting the group will lose the corresponding permissions
-   Easier to manage and update

## Logging and Auditing

Audit trail

-   Recording all protection-oriented activities, important to understanding what happend, why and catching things that should not happen

| File               | Explanation                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/usr/adm/lastlog` | Records the last time a user has logged in; displayed with `finger`      |
| `var/adm/utmp`     | Records accounting information used by the `who` command                 |
| `/var/adm/wtmp`    | Records every time a user logs in/out; displayed with the `last` command |
| `/var/adm/acct`    | Records all executed commands; displayed with `lastcomm`                 |
| `/var/log/`        | In modern Linux systems, log files are located here                      |

# UNIX Security Model

## UNIX

A family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems

-   Originally for small multi-user computers in a friendly network environment
-   Scaled up to commercial

Several flavors of Unix: Unix-like OS

-   Vendor versions differ in the way some security controls are managed and enforced
-   E.g. Solars, FreeBSD, macOS

Security was not a primary design goal

-   Dominant goals were modularity, portability and efficiency
-   Now it provides sufficient security mechanisms that have to be properly configured and administered

## Users

A system can have many accounts

-   Service accounts: Running background processes
-   User accounts: tied to each person

User identifiers (UIDs)

-   16-bit number (size of UID varies for different systems)
-   0 reserved for rroot, 1-99 for other predefined accounts, 100-999 for system accounts/groups. User accounts start from 1000
    -   root (0), bin (1), daemon (2), mail (8), news (9), diego (261)

## SuperUser

A special privileged principal

-   UID 0 and usually the username `root`
-   All security checks are turned off for superuser
    -   All access control mechanisms turned off
    -   Can become arbitrary user
    -   Can change system clock
-   Some restrictions remain but can be overcome
    -   Cannot write to a read-only file system, but can remount the file as writeable
    -   Cannot decrypt passwords, but can reset them

Responsibility

-   Used by OS for essential tasks like login, recording audit log, or access to IO devices
-   A major weakness of Unix; an attacker achieving superuser status effectively takes over the entire system

Protecting superuser

-   Privilege separation: Create users like `uucp` or `daemon` to deal with networking; if a special userr is compromised, not all is lost
-   `root` should not be used as a personal account

## User Information

User account stored in `/etc/passwd`

-   Username: Used when user logs in, 1-32 characters long
-   Password: 'x' indicates the encrypted password is stored in `/etc/shadow`
-   UID: User ID
-   GID: Primary group ID
-   Name: A comment field
-   Homedir: Path the user will be in when they log in
-   Shell: Absolute path of a command/shell

E.g. `root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash`

## Groups

Users belong to one or more groups

-   Group info stored in `/etc/group`
    -   Group name
    -   Password
    -   GID
    -   List of users
-   Each user belongs to a primary group, the ID can be found in `/etc/passwd`

For e.g. `adm:x:4:syslog,asdf`

Group is convenient for access control decisions

-   Easier for users to share teh same access control permissions or resources
-   E.g. put all users allowed to access email in a group called `mail`

## Processes

A process has a process ID (PID)

-   New processes generated with `exec` or `fork`

A process has 2 types of User ID and Group ID

-   Real UID/GID: Typically the UID/GID of the user that logs onto the system
-   Effective UID/GID: Inherited from the parent process or from the file being executed. This determines the permissions for this process

## File, Directory and Devices

Files, directories, memory devices, IO devices are uniformly treated as reousrces

-   These reousrces are the objects of access control
-   Each resource has a single user owner and group owner

```
drwxrwxr-x 5 asdf asdf 4096 Jul 17 03:20 .
```

-   File permissions (Read r, Write w, Execute x)
-   Link counter: Number of links (directory entries pointing to) the file
-   Username
-   Group name
-   File size
-   Modified date/time
-   File name

## File Permissions

Three permissions with three subjects

-   Read, write, execute
-   Owner, group, other
-   Examples:
    -   rw-r--r--: Read and write access for owner, read access for group and other
    -   rwx------: Read, write, execute access for owner, norights to group and other

Octal representation

-   rw-r--r--: 110 100 100: 644
-   rwxrwxrwx: 111 111 111: 777

Adjust permissions

-   User can change permissions
    -   `chmod 754 filename`
    -   `chmod u+wrx, g+rx, g-w, o+r, o-wx filename`
-   root can change the ownerships
    -   `chown user:group filename`

## Controlled Invocation

Superuser privilege is required to execute certain OS functions

-   E.g. password changing
    -   User passwords are usually stored in `/etc/shadow`
    -   This file is owned by root superuser. So a regular user does not have R/W access to it
    -   When user wants to change password with the program `passwd`, the program needs to give him additional permissions to write to `/etc/shadow`

SUID: Special flag for a program

-   If SUID is enabled, then user who executes this program will inherit permission of that program's owner
-   `passwd` has such SUID enabled. When a user executes this program to change his password, he gets additional permissions to write to the new password to `/etc/shadow`

## Security of Controlled Invocation

many other SUID programs with the owner of root

-   `/bin/passwd`: Change password
-   `/bin/login`: Login program
-   `/bin/su`: Change UID program

Potential dangers

-   As the user has the program owner's privileges when running a SUID program, the program should only do what the owner intended
-   By tricking a SUID program owned by root to do uninteded things, an attacker can act as the root

Security considerations

-   All user input (including command line arguments and environmental variables) must be processed with extreme care
-   Programs should have SUID status only if it is really necessary
-   Integrity of SUID programs must be monitored

# Security Vulnerabilties of OS

Different kinds of malware

-   Adware
-   Ransomware
-   Spyware
-   Crimeware
-   Worms
-   Viruses
-   Trojans
-   Rootkits
-   Backdoor

## Rootkit

Malware that obtains root privileges to compromise the computer

-   Root user does no go through any security checks, and can perform any actions to the system
    -   Insert and execute arbitrary malicious code in the system's code path
    -   Hide its existence, e.g. malicious processes, files, etc. from being detected

How can attacker gain root privileges?

-   Vulnerabiltiies in software stack: buffer overlow, format string etc

There are some common techniques for rootkits to compromise the system

## System Call Table

A system call is an interface that allows user-level processes to request functions or services from the kernel level

-   E.g. process control, file management, device management

How to issue system call?

-   System call table: A table of pointers in the kernel region to different system call functions
-   A user process passes the index of the system call and corresponding parameters with the following API: `syscall(SYS_call, arg1, arg2, ...);`

## Hijacking System-Call Table

Rootkits change pointers of certain entries in the system call table

-   Other processes calling these system calls will execute attacker's code

E.g.

-   `syscall_open` is used to display the running process (`ps`)
-   Rootkit redirects this system call to `new_syscall_open`
    -   When object to be opened matches the malicious name, return `NULL` to hide
    -   Otherwise, call normal `old_syscall_open`

## Compromise System Call Functions

In addition to changing the pointer, rootkits can directly change the system call function

-   `syscall_open` is used to display the running process
-   Replace the first 7 bytes of `syscall_open` as jump to `malicious_open`
    -   This faked system call will issue malicious function, restore the original system call and then call the correct one

## Hijack Interrupt Descriptor Table

An interrupt is a signal from the hardware/software to notify the processor that something needs to be handled immediately

-   After receiving the signal, the processor issues the interrupt handler
-   Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT): A table of pointers to different interrupt handler functions
-   Rootkits can alter the pointer in the IDT to make the processor execute the wrong function

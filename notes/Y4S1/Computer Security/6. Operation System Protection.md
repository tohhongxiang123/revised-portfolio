# Operation System Protection

# Confinement

An important security strategy in OS protection

- When some component in the system is compromised or malicious, we need to prevent it from harming the rest of the system
- Confinement: Restrict its impact on other components

Application scenario:

- Cutoff propagation chain
- Malware testing and analysis

## Virtual Machine: OS Level Isolation

Virtualisation is the fundamental technology for cloud computing

- Different operating systems run on the same amchine
- Each virtual machine has an independent OS, logically isolated from others

Technical support

- Software layer: Hypervisor or Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) for virtualising and managing the underlying resources and enforcing isolation
- Hardware layer: Hardware virtualisation extensions such as Intel VT-x, and AMD-V for accelerating vritualisation and improving performance

Pros

- Provide better efficiency in the usage of physical resources as different VMs can share the same resources
- Provide support for multiple distinct operating systems and associated applications on one physical system
- High isolation across different VMs so malware inside one VM will not affect other VMs or the hypervisor

Cons

- The introduction of a hypervisor can incur a larger attack surface
  - Hypervisor has a big code base and inevitably brings more software bugs
  - Hypervisor has higher privilege than OS kernel. If hypervisor is compromised, then the attacker can take control of the entire system easily

## VM for Malware Analysis

Malware analysis: Deploying malware in the OS and observing its malicious behaviors

- Deploying the malware in the native OS has the potential to compromise the entire system
- VM: An ideal environment for testing malware
  - Malware cannot cause damages outside the VM
  - Malware's behavior can be observed from the hypervisor

Hypervisor detection

- A smart malware can detect that it is running inside a VM, not the actual environment, and then behave like normal applications
  - Virtual machine is a simulated environment
  - Hypervisor introduces access latency variance
  - Hypervisor shares TLB with all the OSes
    - A translation lookaside buffer (TLB) is a type of memory cache that stores recent translations of virtual memory to physical addresses to enable faster retrieval.

## Container: Process Level Isolation

A standard unit of software

- Package the code and all its dependencies into one unit
- Each container is a lightweight standalone exectuable software package that includes everything needed to run the application
- Different applications in different containers are isolated
- A container engine is introduced to manage different containers
- E.g. docker

# Reference Monitor

A security mechanism that monitors and mediates requests from the protected targets at runtime

- Enforce some security policies such as confinement
- When any security policy is violated, RM can deny the request
- Protected target sends requests to the reference monitor. The reference monitor checks whether security policies are violated in the request, and either allows/denies the request

## Types of RMs

- OS-based RM
  - The OS monitors the system calls issued by the application
- Software-based RM
  - Interpreter
  - Inline RM: Integrate RM into the program or rewriting compiled program
- Hardware based RM
  - Memory address access
- Network based RM
  - Firewalls

## Requirements of RM

Functional requirements

- The reference validation mechanism must always be invoked
- RM is able to observe all requests
- RM is able to deny malicious requests

Security requirements

- The reference validation mechanism must be tamper-proof

Assurance requirement

- The reference validation mechanism must be small enough to be analysed and tested

## Hardware-based Reference Monitors

The OS is the arbitrator of access requests. It is itself an object of access control

Hardware based RMs are introduced to monitor the OS

- Memory access: Each process has a dedicated virtual memory address. Hardware is responsible for checking each memory access
- Distinct user and kernel modes
  - At any time, CPU is in one mode
  - Privileged instructions can only be issued in kernel mode
  - Whenm the user mode wants to execute such privileged functions, it switches to kernel mode (through a syscall or interrupt) for execution. When finished, it goes back to the user mode (controlled invocation)

# System Integrity Protection and Verification

## Computer System

A hierarchic view: layered system

- Different scenarios may have different layers
- Lower layers have higher privileges and can protect higher layers
- Lower layers need to be better protected

Chains of trust: Establish verified systems from bottom to top

- Bottom layers validate teh integrity of the top layers
- If verification passes, then it is safe to launch
- Each layer is vulnerable to attack from below, if the lower layers are not secured properly

## Integrity Verification

Only execute code signed by an entity we trust

- Load the bootloader in the firmware
- Reads and verifies kernel
- Only loads kernel if signature is verified
- Similarly, kernel can run only verified applications

## Root of Trust

Software is not always trusted

- Can be tampered with at any phase
- There are still vulnerabilities when using software to protect other software

Hardware is more trusted

- After the chip is fabricated, it is hard for the attacker to modify it. The integrity of hardware can be guaranteed
- It is very hard for the attacker to peek into the chip and steal the secret (e.g. encryption keys). Confidentiality of hardware is guaranteed
- Hardware is a perfect component as the start of the chain of trust. It is regarded as secure for initialising the integrity verification

## Trusted Platform Module (TPM)

- [What is TPM](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/what-is-tpm-705f241d-025d-4470-80c5-4feeb24fa1ee)

A chip integrated into the platform

- A separated co-processor
- Its state cannot be compromised by malicious host system software

Inside the chip

- Random number and key generators
- Crypto execution engines
- Different types of crypto keys

## Security Functionality: Platform Integrity

Building a chain of trust

- Establish a secure boot process from the TPM and continue until the OS has fully booted and applications are running

Application

- Digital right management
- Enforcement of software licenses e.g. Microsoft office
- Prevention of cheating in online games e.g. Riot Vanguard

## Security Functionality: Data Encryption

Full disk encryption

- Encrypt data with key in the hardware
- It is difficult for any attacker to steal the key, which never leaves the chip
- TPM can also provide platform authentication before data encryption

Applications: Windows Bitlocker

- Disk data is encrypted with encryption key FVEK
- FVEK is further encrypted with Storage Root Key (SRK) in TPM
- When decrypting the data, BitLocker asks the TPM to verify the platform integrity. Then it asks TPM to decrypt FVEK with SRK. Then, BitLocker uses FVEK to decrypt the data
- With this process, data can only be decrypted on the correct platform with the correct software launced

## Security Functionality: Remote Attestation

Scenario: Alice launches an application on a remote server. How does she know whether this application is executing securely on a trusted platform?

Remote attestation

- A remote platform provides unforgeable evidence about the security of its software to a client
- A common strategy to prove the OS and applications running on the platform are intact and trustworthy

## Major Components for Remote Attestation

Integrity measurement architecture

- Must be able to provide reliable and trustworthy security report
- Solution: TPM provides the platform integrity measurement service, and the measurement cannot be compromised by any malicious OS or apps

Remote attestation protocol

- Attestation report must be transmitted to the client without being modified by any attacker in the OS, apps or network
- Cryptographic protocols are used to secure the report
- Solution: TPM is equipped with crypto keys that can be used to encrypt and sign the messages, making integrity measurement unforgeable

## Remote Attestation with TPM

Integrity measurement architecture

- TPM measures the hash values of the code of each loaded software as the integrity report
- The hash values are stored in the Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) in TPM

Remote attestation protocol

- TPM generates Attestation Identity Key (AIK) to sign the hash values
- The hash values together with the AIK will be sent to Alice
- A trusted third party, Privacy Certification Authority (PCA) is called to verify that this AIK is indeed from the correct platform
- Alice uses this AIK to verify that the received hash values are authentic
- By checking the hash values, Alice knows if the loaded software is correct or not

# Trusted Execution Environment

## Untrusted Privileged Software

Chains of trust

- The secure execution of an application relies on the security of underlying software and hardware layers
- Easy to ensure the security of hardware
- It is more challenging to ensure the security of privileged software (such as the OS or hypervisor)

Security of privileged software

- TPM can guarantee the privileged software is intact at loading time, but not the security at runtime
- Privileged software usually has a large code base, which inevitably contains many vulnerabilities
- Once the privileged software is compromised, the attacker can do anything to any apps running on it

How to protect applications with untrusted privileged OS or hypervisor? We use a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)

- Introduce new hardware to protect apps from untrusted OS or hypervisor
- The OS or hypervisor can support the execution of apps but cannot compromise them
  - Cannot read data of apps
  - Cannot change code of apps

Different processors have been developed to support TEE

- Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX)
- AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualisation (SEV)
- ARM TrustZone

## Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX)

Enclave

- An isolated and protected region for the code and data of an applications
- Data in the enclave are encrypted by the processor when they are stored in the memory
  - Only the processor can access data. Attempts from other apps or OS will be forbidden and raise an exception

Application execution with enclaves

- An application is divided into a trusted and untrusted part
- The untrusted part creates an enclave and puts the trusted part into it
- When trusted code needs to be executed, the processor enters the enclave. In this mode, only the trusted code can be executed and access the data
- After code is completed, processor exits from the enclave

Attestation

- Similar as the TPM, SGX also provides attestation service, which enables another party to attest what code is running inside the enclave
- Integrity measurement architecture: enclave measurement of the code, data, stack, heap, security flags, location of each page etc.
  - Attestation protocol: attestation key

Remote attestation

- A remote client attests the integrity of the code in the enclave

Local attestation

- In some scenarios, multiple enclaves collaborate on the same task, exchanging data at runtime
- The 2 exchanging enclaves have to prove to each other that they can be trusted

## Applications of SGX: Double-edged sword

Positive usage

- Cloud computing: You do not need to trust the cloud provider
- Digital right management
- Cryptocurrency

Negative usage: Adversaries leverage SGX to hide malicious activities for stealthier attacks

- Malware
- Ransomware

## AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualisation (SEV)

TEE for the virtualised platform

- In the conventional platform, the hypervisor has the privilege to control all the VMs. A compromised hypervisor can do anything to the VMs running on top of it
- AMD SEV: A hardware extension to protect VMs against the hypervisor and other VMs

Mechanism: The processor encrypts the data (memory page, registers, configurations etc) of the guest VMs, so the hypervisor is not allowed to access the data

## AMD Secure Memory Encryption (SME)

Virtual memory encryption is realised by SME

- An AMD architectural capability for main memory encryption
- Performed via dedicated hardware in the memory controllers
- Uses AES engine to encrypt data and control with C-bit in Page Table Entry

C-bit

- Locate at physical address bit 47
- Set this bit to 1 to indicate this page is encrypted
- Allows users to encrypt full memory of the VM, or selected memory pages

## ARM TrustZone

The first commercial TEE processor

- Creates 2 environments that run simultaneously on the same processor. Each world has an independent OS
- Normal world: Runs the normal unprotected applications and a rich OS. They have restricted access to the hardware resources in the secure world
- Secure world: Runs the sensitive protected applications, and a smaller secure OS, isolating them from the untrusted world. They have full access to the hardware resources in the normal world

Context switch

- The non-secure bit in the Secure Configuration Register is used to determine which world the processor is currently running in
- A third privilege mode: Secure monitor, in addition to user and kernel
- When the processor wants to switch the world, it first issues a special instruction Secure Monitor Call (SMC) to enter the secure monitor mode. Then it performs some cleaning works and enters the other world

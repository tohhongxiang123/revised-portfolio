# SingHealth Data Breach

# Summary

-   Between 23/8/17 and 20/7/18, a cyberattack was carried out on SingHealth's patient database
-   DB was illegally accessed, and 1.5 million patients sensitive information (name/nric/address/DOB) were exfiltrated
-   Around 159000 patients had their outpatient dispensed medication records exfiltrated
-   The target was the SingHealth's SCM database, an electronic medical records software solution, which allowed healthcare workers to access real-time patient data
-   Users access SCM database using Citrix servers, which operate as an intermediary between the front-end workstations and the database backend
-   The Citrix server played a big role in the Cyber Attack
-   At the time of the cyberattack, SingHealth owns the SCM system
-   Integrated Health Information Systems Private Limited (IHiS) was responsible for administering and operating the system, including implementing cybersecurity measures.
-   IHiS was responsible for security incident response and reporting

Workflow:

1. User launches SCM via CITRIX at user pc
2. User credentials sent to SCM security for authentication
3. Authenticated by SCM security
4. User successfully logs in and starts using SCM

Key Events of Cyberattack

1. Initial entry (23 aug 2017)
2. Lateral movement and privilege escalation (dec 2017 - june 2018)
3. Compromised SCM (26 june 2018)
4. Queried SCM database (27 june 2018 - 4 july 2018)
5. Data transferred (27 june 2018 - 4 july 2018)

-   The attackers gained initial access to SingHealth's IT network around 23 aug 2017, infecting front-end workstations, likely through phishing attacks
-   Attacker laid dormant for about 4 months before commencing lateral movements (6 months) in the network between dec 2017 and jun 2018, compromising many endpoints and servers, including Citrix servers located in SGH, connected to SCM database
-   Along the way, attacker also compromised many other user and administrator accounts, including domain administrator accounts
-   From May 2018, attacker used compromised user accounts in singhealth IT network and suspected virtual machines to remotely connect to SGH Citrix servers
-   Attackers initially tried unsuccessfully to access SCM database from SGH Citrix servers
-   IHiS's IT Administrators first noticed unauthorised login attempts to Citrix servers and failed attempts at accessing SCM DB on 11 jun 2018
-   On 27 jun 2018, attacker began querying SCM database, stealing and exfiltrating patient records, and doing so undetected by IHiS
-   1 week later (4 jul), an IHiS administrator from SCM system noticed suspicious queries made on the SCM database
-   Working with other IT administrators, ongoing suspicious queries were terminated, measures were put into place to prevent further queries to SCM database
-   Measures were successful, and attacker could not make further queries to database after 4 jul
-   Between 11/6/18 and 9/7/18, people who knew of and responded to the attack were only the IHiS line-staff and middle management from various IT teams, and security team
-   After 1 month (9/7/18), IHiS senior management were informed of cyberattack
-   After 3 days (10/7/18), matter was escalated to Cyber Security Agency (CSA), SingHealth's senior management, Ministry of Health (MOH) and ministry of health holdings (MOHH)
-   Starting on 10/7/18, IHiS and CSA carried out investigations and remediation
-   Measures aimed at containing the existing threat, eliminating attacker's footholds, and preventing recurrence of attack were implemented
-   In view of further malicious activities on 19/7/18, internet surfing separation was implemented for SingHealth on 20/7/18
-   No further suspicious activity detected after 20/7/18
-   Public announcement made on 20/7/18, and patient outreach and communications commenced immediately after

There were 5 key findings

1. IHiS staff did not have adequate levels of cybersecurity awareness, training, and resources to appreciate the security implications of their findings and to respond effectively to the attack
2. Certain IHiS staff holding key roles in IT security incident response and reporting failed to take appropriate, effective, or timely action, resulting in missed opportunities to prevent the stealing and exfiltrating of data in the attack
3. There were a number of vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and misconfigurations in the SingHealth network and SCM system that contributed to the attackerâ€™s success in obtaining and exfiltrating the data, many of which could have been remedied before the attack
4. The attacker was a skilled and sophisticated actor bearing the characteristics of an Advanced Persistent Threat group
    - Attacker had a clear goal in mind, namely the personal and outpatient medical records of the Prime Minister, and other patients
    - Attacker employed advanced TTPs (tools/tactics, techniques, procedures) as seen from the suite of advanced customised and stealthy malware used, generally stealthy movements, and its ability to find and exploit various vulnerabilities in SingHealth's IT network and SCM application
    - Attacker was persistent, establishing multiple footholds and backdoors, carried out its attack over 10 months, making multiple attempts to access SCM database with various methods
    - Attacker was a well-resourced group, with extensive command and control network, the capabilities to develop numerous customised tools, and a wide range of technical expertise
5. While our cyber defences will never be impregnable, and it may be difficult to prevent an Advanced Persistent Threat from breaching the perimeter of the network, the success of the attacker in obtaining and exfiltrating the data was not inevitable

Key notes

-   Effective training methods to detect phishing must be conducted to all staff
-   Internet connections on prized assets must be regulated, especially remote access from home or outside the company
-   Access to important servers must have 2FA and should not be bypassed
-   Any coding vulnerability in the application we use must be patched ASAP, cannot rely on users to do so
-   Strong password policy and enforcement
-   Vulnerabilities highlighted in pen-tests must be fixed immediately
-   Inactive email accounts should be removed immediately to reduce attack surface area

# Cyber Kill Chain Framework

7-step Cyber Kill Chain Framework is a framework which identifies what adversaries must complete in order to achieve their objectives, going through 7 stages starting from **early reconnaissance** to the final goal of **data exfiltration**.

Having this framework in mind will facilitate the understanding of the actions and tactics, techniques and procedures of the attackers

1. Reconnaissance: Harvesting email addresses, conference information etc
2. Weaponisation: Coupling exploit with backdoors into deliverable payloads
3. Delivery: Delivering weaponised bundle to victims via email, USB, web etc
4. Exploitation: Exploiting vulnerability to execute code on a victim's system
5. Installation: Installing malware on the asset
6. Command and Control: Command channel for remote manipulation of victim
7. Actions on Objective: With "Hands on Keyboard" access, intruders accomplish their original goals

## First Evidence of Breach and Establishing Control over Workstation A

-   Forensic investigations uncovered signs of callbacks to an overseas command and control server (c2 server) from 23 aug 2017
-   Callbacks refer to communications between malware and c2 server, to either fetch updates and instructions or send back stolen information

CSA discovered many malicious artifacts in workstation A, including

-   Log file, which was a remnant of a malware set
-   Publicly available hacking tool
    -   Enables the attacker to maintain persistent presence once an email account is breached, even if the password to the account is subsequently changed
    -   Also allows hacker to
        -   Interact remotely with mail exchange servers
        -   Perform simple brute force attacks on user's email account password
        -   Serve as a hidden backdoor for attacker to regain entry into the system in the event that initial implants are removed
-   Customised remote access trojan (RAT1)
    -   Logfile was a remnant file of a known malware which has password dumping capabilities
    -   RAT1 provided attacker with the capability to access and control workstation, enabling attacker to perform functions such as executing shell scripts remotely, and uploading/downloading files

Logfile was created on Workstation A on 29 aug 2017, the file contained password credentials in plaintext, which belonged to the user of workstation A

-   Malware was also likely used by attacker to obtain passwords for privilege escalation and lateral movement

Public hacking tool was installed on Workstation A on 1 dec 2017, by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of "Outlook" that was installed on the workstation

-   Although a patch was available at that time, the patch was not installed on workstation A
-   Tool was thus succesfully installed and was used to download malicious files onto workstation A
-   Some of these files masqueraded as .jpg images, but contained malicious powershell scripts, one of which is thought to be a modified powershell script taken from an open-source post-exploitation tool

With the introduction of RAT1 in dec 2017, attacker gained the capability to execute shell scripts remotely, as well as upload/download files from/to workstation A

-   Referring to cyber kill chain framework, attacker was able to go through Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command and Control phases by 1 dec 2017

## Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement

After the attacker established an initial foothold on workstation A, it moved laterally in the network between dec 2017 and june 2018

-   Compromised a number of endpoints and servers, including the Citrix servers located in SGH, which were connected to the SCM database

Evidence of attacker's lateral movements was found in the proliferation of malware across a number of endpoints and servers

-   Malware samples found and analysed by CSA were either tools that were stealthy by design, or unique variants that were not seen in the wild, and not detected by standard anti-malware tools
-   Such malware included RAT1, and another remote access trojan referred to as RAT2, and the malware associated with the earlier mentioned log file
-   Evidence of powershell commands used by the attacker to distribute malware to infect other machines, and malicious files being copied between machines over mapped network drives
-   CSA also assessed that the attacker likely compromised the windows authentication system and obtained administrator and user credentials
-   This means that the attacker would have gained full control over all windows-based servers and hosted applications, all employee workstations, and underlying data, within the domain

Establishing control over workstation B on 17 apr 2018

-   Attacker gained access over workstation B (SGH) and planted RAT2, thus gaining control of the workstation which had access to the SCM application
-   Workstation B was used to login remotely to SGH Citrix servers 1 and 2. Also suspected that workstation B was used to host virtual machines

## Queries to SCM Database from 26 June to 4 Jul 2018

From 26 june to 4 jul, the attacker began querying the database from Citrix server 2 using the A.A. account

The attacker ran 3 types of SQL queries

1. Reconnaissance on the schema of the SCM database
2. Direct queries relating to particular individuals
3. Bulk queries on patients in general

The attacker was able to retrieve the following information from SQL queries

1. Prime Minister's personal and outpatient medical data
2. Demographic records for 1495364 patients, including their names, nrics, addresses, gender, race, date of birth
3. The outpatient dispensed medication records of about 159000 of the above patients

Data exfiltration route:

-   SCM DB server -> Citrix server 2 -> Workstation A -> C2 servers

The copying and exfiltration of data from the SCM database was stopped on 4 jul 2018, after IHiS staff discovered the suspicious queries, and took steps to prevent similar queries from being run against the SCM database

## Attempts to Re-Enter SingHealth Network 18 and 19 Jul

-   After detection of malware and communications from the SP servers, CSA recommended that internet surfing separation be implemented to prevent attacker from exercising command and control over any remaining footholds it may have in the network
-   Internet surfing separation was implemented on 20 jul 2018
-   No further signs of malicious activities detected thereafter

# Contributing Factors Leading to Cyberattack

Network connections between SGH citrix servers and SCM database were allowed

-   The open connection is not necessary, more for convenience to access database
-   A basic security review of network architecture and connectivity between SGH Citrix server and SCM database could have shown that the open network connection created a security vulnerability
-   However, no such review was carried out
-   Should not have had an open connection in the first place

Lack of monitoring at SCM database for unusual queries and access

-   From 26 june to 4 jul, attacker ran queries on SCM database, including bulk queries
-   Attacker could do so unchallenged because of a lack of monitoring at the scm database
-   No existing controls to detect bulk queries being made to SCM database
-   No controls in place to detect or block queries to the SCM database made using illegitimate applications
-   There were database activity monitoring (DAM) solutions available on the market which could address some or all of the gaps highlighted above, but DAM was not implemented by IHiS at that time of attack

SGH Citrix servers not adequately secured against unauthorised access

-   The compromise of the SGH citrix servers was critical in giving the attackers access to the SCM database
-   Privileged access management was not the exclusive means for accessing SGH Citrix servers, and logins to the servers by other means were possible without 2FA
-   IHiS Citrix administrators were aware of this insecure alternative, and made use of it for convenience, sacrificing security
-   Lack of firewalls to prevent unauthorised remote access using RDP (remote desktop protocol, allows users to execute remote operations on other computers) to the SGH citrix server

Observations on Overall Management of SGH Citrix Servers

-   They were not treated as mission critical, unlike SCM database
-   SGH Citrix servers were not monitored for realtime analysis and alerts of vulnerabilities and issues arising from these servers
-   Vulnerability scanning which was carried out on mission-critical systems were not carried out on SGH Citrix servers
    -   Vulnerability scanning: Inspection of potential points of exploits in a computer to identify gaps in security

Internet connectivity in SingHealth IT network increased the attack surface

-   The SingHealth's network connection to the internet, while serving their operational needs, created an avenue of entry and exit for the attacker
-   This allowed the attacker to make use of an internet-connected workstation (workstation A) to gain access to the network, before making his way into the SCM database to steal medical data
-   Security risks arising from internet connectivity in SingHealth network were raised by CSA to MOH from as early as august 2015
-   By june 2017, healthcare sector determined that
    -   Internet access would be removed for staff that do not require it
    -   For staff that required internet access, access would be through a secure internet access platform, which, at that time, was to take the form of a remote browser

Version of outlook used by IHiS not patched against a publicly available hacking tool

-   Attacker was able to install hacking tool which was publicly available by exploiting a vulnerability in the version of outlook installed on the workstation
-   A patch that was effective in preventing this vulnerability from being exploited was available since 2017, but not installed
-   Clear need to improve software upgrade policies

Extensive C2 infrastructure

-   CSA's forensic analysis revealed that a number of network indicators of compromise (IOC) which appeared to be overseas C2 servers. CSA explained that C2 servers were mainly used for
    -   Infection: Server is used as a means to drop malware into the system it is trying to infect
    -   Data exfiltration: There were indications of data being sent to these servers
    -   Beacon: Infected machines may have connected to the C2 servers to establish a heartbeat: a slow, rhythmic communication meant to just sustain communications

# Actions of COI Committee

The committee made 16 recommendations, 7 of which are priority, to be implemented immediately

Priority:

1. An enhanced security structure and readiness must be adopted by IHiS and Public Health Institutions
    - Cybersecurity must be viewed as a risk management issue, not just a technical issue. Decisions must be deliberated at the appropriate management level, to balance trade-offs between security, operational requirements and cost
    - IHiS must adopt "defence in depth" approach

    - Password policies must be implemented and enforced across both domain and local accounts
    - Server local administrator accounts must be centrally managed across IT network
    - Service accounts with higher privileges must be managed and controlled
6. Incident response process must be improved for more effective response to cyber attacks
    - To ensure response processes are effective, they must be regularly tested
    - Predefined modes of communication must be used during incident response
    - Correct balance must be struck between containment, remediation and eradication, and the need to monitor an attacker and preserve critical evidence
    - Information and data necessary to investigate an incident must be readily available
    - Advanced Security Operation Center or Cyber Defence Center should be established to improve the ability to detect and respond to intrusions
7. Partnerships between industries and government to achieve a higher level of collective security
    - Threat intelligence sharing should be enhanced
    - Partnerships with Internet Service Providers should be strengthened
    - Defence beyond borders: Cross-border and cross-sector partnerships should be strengtened
    - Using a network to defend a network: Applying behavioral analytics for collective defence

Additional:

8. IT security risk assessments and audit processes must be treated seriously and carried out regularly
    - IT security risk assessments and audits are vital to ascertain gaps in organisational policies, processes and procedures
    - IT security risk assessments must be conducted on CII and mission-critical systems annually, and on specified events
    - Audit action items must be immediately remediated
9. Enhanced safeguards must be put in place to protect electronic medical records
    - Clear policy on measures to secure confidentiality, integrity and accountability of electronic medical records must be formulated
    - Databases containing patient data must be monitored in real-time for suspicious activities
    - End user access to electronic health records must be made more secure
    - Measures should be considered to secure data at rest
    - Controls must be implemented to protect against the risk of data exfiltration
    - Access to sensitive data must be restricted at both front-end and database levels
10. Domain controllers must be better secured against attack
    - OS for domain controllers must be regularly updated, to harden these servers against the risk of cyber attacks
    - Attack surface for domain controllers should be reduced by limiting login access
    - Admin access to domain controllers must require 2FA
11. Robust patch management process must be implemented to address security vulnerabilties
    - Clear policy on patch management must be formulated and implemented
    - Patch management process must provide for oversight with the reporting of appropriate metrics
12. Software upgrade policy with focus on security must be implemented to increase cyber resilience
    - Detailed policy regarding software upgrading must be formulated and implemented
    - Appropriate governance structure must be put in place to ensure that software upgrade policy is adhered to
13. Internet access strategy that minimises exposure to external threats should be implemented
    - Internet access strategy should be considered afresh, in the light of the cyber attack
    - In formulating its strategy, healthcare sector should take into account the benefits and drawbacks of internet surfing separation and internet isolation technology, and put in place mitigating controls to address residual risks
14. Incident response plans must more clearly state when and how a security incident is reported
    - An incident response plan for IHiS staff must be formulated for security incidents relating to cluster systems and assets
    - Incident response plan must clearly state that an attempt to compromise the system is a reportable security incident
    - Incident response plan must include wide-ranging examples of security incidents, and corresponding indicators of attack
15. Competence of computer security incident response personnel must be significantly improved
    - Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) must be well trained to more effectively respond to security incidents
    - CERT must be better equipped with necessary hardware and software
    - A competent and qualified Security Incident Response Manager who understands and can execute the required roles and responsibilities must be appointed
16. Post-breach independent forensic review of the network, all endpoints and SCM system should be considered
    - IHiS should consider working with experts to ensure no traces of the attacker are left behind

# Authentication and Passwords

There are 7 key concepts in computer security

1. Confidentiality (Secrecy of contents, solved by encryption)
   - Keep the contents of a transient communication or data on temporary or persistent storage secret
2. Data/message integrity (Unmodified, solved by MAC-msg auth code)
   - Not allowing a third party to be able to modify the contents of a message
3. Availability (Access, solved by adding redundancy)
   - A system that can respond to its user's requests in a reasonable timeframe
4. Authentication (Identity, solved by 2FA)
   - Authentication is the act of verifying someone's identity, important in cyberspace
5. Non-repudiation (Undeniability - solved by digital signatures)
   - Ensure undeniability of a transaction by any of the parties involved
6. Authorisation (Permission - solved by Access Control List)
   - The act of checking whether a user has permission to conduct an action
7. Accountability (Who is responsible - solved by log trail)
   - Ensure that you are able to determine who is the attacker when something goes wrong, or an errorneous transaction is identified

# Authentication

When Bob wants to communicate with Alice, how can Bob be sure that he is communicating with Alice, and not someone trying to impersonate her?

- Bob can authenticate and verify Alice's identity based on one or more of 3 types of methods
  - Something you know
  - Something you have
  - Something you are

# Something you know: Passwords

- Ask Alice for some secret only Alice should know, such as her password
- If Alice produces the right password, Bob can assume he is communicating with Alice
- Passwords are so prevalently used that we will further study how to properly build a password management system
- Advantages of using passwords:
  - Password schemes are simple to implement compared to other authentication schemes such as biometrics
  - Simple for users to understand
- Disadvantages of passwords:
  - Most users do not choose strong passwords, which are hard for the attacker to guess
    - Users usually choose passwords that are simple concatenations of common names, dictionary words, or other easy-to-guess terms/phrases
  - Susceptible to keyloggers
    - If attacker can successfully listen in on a password just once, the attacker can log in as the user

How hackers crack your passwords

- They will commonly sniff and extract the password hash over the internet as you login
- They will write or use a password cracking program with a dictionary of common passwords, and crack it offline
- They store password hashes in dictionaries
- If your password hash appears in the dictionary, the attackers can easily figure out your password
- Password cracking programs can easily determine 10-20% of usernames and passwords in a system
- To gain access to a system, an attacker only requires a valid username and password
- Passwords are relatively easy to crack unless users are forced to choose passwords that are hard for such password-cracking programs to guess

One-time password (OTP) system forces user to enter a new password each time he/she logs in, eliminates the risks of using a password multiple times

- With this system, the user is given a list of passwords, the first time she logs in, she is asked for the first password
- The second time she logs in, she is asked for the second password
- Major problem with this system is that no user will remember all passwords
- However, a device could be used to keep track of all the different passwords the user would need to use each time she logs in
- Basic idea from "something you know" to "something you have"

# Something You Have

A second general method of authenticating a user is based on something that a user has

- OTP cards
- Smart cards
- ATM cards

OTP cards

- OTP products generate a new password each time a user logs in
- One such product is the SecurID card
- SecurID card is a device that flashes a new password to the user periodically
- When the user wants to log into a computer system, he enters the numbers displayed on the card when prompted by the server
- Server knows the algorithm of the SecurID card used to generate passwords, and can verify the password that the user eners
- OTP systems traditionally required users to carry additional devices, now they are integrated into personal digital assistants and cellphones

Smart Cards

- New gen smart cards are tamper-resistant: If an attacker tries to open the card or gain access to the info stored on it, the card will self-destruct
- Microprocessor, memory and other components that make up the smart card are epoxied together such that there is no easy way to take the card apart
- The only feasible way to communicate with the microprocessor is through its electronic interface
- Smart cards were designed with the idea that the infromation stored in the card's memory would only be accessible through the microprocessor
- A smart card's microprocessor runs software that can authenticate a user, while guarding any secret information stored on the card
- In a typical scenario, a user enters a smart card into a smart card reader which contains a numeric keypad
- Smart card issues a "challenge" to the reader
- The user is required to enter a PIN into the reader, and the reader computes a response to the challenge
- If the smart card receives a correct response, the user is considered authenticated, and access to use the secret information stored on the smart card is granted
- One problem with smart cards for authentication is that the smart card reader must be trusted
  - A rogue smart card reader installed by an attacker can record a user's PIN, and if the attacker can then gain possession of the smart card himself, he can authenticate himself to the smart card as if he were the real user
- Attacks against smart cards have been engineered by experts
  - By studying a smart card's pwoer consumption, attackers can determine the contents stored on the card
  - While such attacks are possible, they require a reasonable amount of expertise from the attacker
  - Over time, such attacks may become easier to carry out by an average attacker

ATM Cards

- Another example of a security mechanism based on some secret a user has
- The back of the ATM card has a magnetic stripe that stores data - the user's account number
- This data is used as part of the authentication process when a user wants to use the ATM
- ATM cards are not tamper-resistant - anyone who has a magnetic stripe reader can access the info stored on the card without need of any additional information such as PIN
- Since magnetic stripe of ATM card is easy to copy, credit card companies also sometimes incorporate holograms or other hard-to-copy elements on the cards themselves

# Something You Are: Biometric

Most authentication techniques that fall into this category are biometric techniques, in which something about the user's biology is measured

- When considering a biometric authentication technique as part of your system, it is important to consider its effectiveness and social acceptability

Palm scan

- Reader measures the size of a person's hand and fingers, and the curves that exist on their palm and fingers
- Also incorporates fingerprint scans on each of the fingers
- Palm scan technique is much more effective than a single fingerprint scan

Iris Scan

- Camera takes a picture of a person's iris, and stores certain features about it in the system
- Studies have shown that iris scan is more socially acceptable than palm scan
- Iris scan is less intrusive, since the user does not have to do anything except look in a particular direction

Retina Scan

- Infrared light is shot into a user's eyes, and the pattern of retinal blood vessels is read to create a signature that is stored by a computer system
- In a retinal scan, user puts his head in front of a device, then the device blows a puff of air and shoots a laser into the user's eye
- A retinal scan is more intrusive than an iris/palm scan

Fingerprint scan

- In fingerprinting, the user places her finger onto a reader that scans the set of curves that makes up her fingerprint
- Fingerprinting is not as socially accepted as other biometric identification techniques, since people generally associate taking fingerprints with criminal activity
- Fingerprinting also provides less information than a palm scan

Voice identification

- Voice identification is a mechanism which a computer asks a user to say a particular phrase
- Computer system checks the electronically coded signals of the user's voice, compares them to a databank of previous signals and determines whether there is close enough of a match

Face recognition

- Involves a camera taking a picture of a person's face and a computer system trying to recognise its features

Signature

- Records not only the user's signature, but also the pressure and timing at which the user makes various curves and motions while writing
- Advantage of signature dynamics over simple signature matching is that it is far more difficult to replicate

## Disadvantages of Biometrics

- Number of false positives
  - Impersonator successfully impersonates the user
- Number of false negatives
  - A user is truly an authentic user of the system, but the biometric authentication device rejects the user
- Varying social acceptance
  - All biometric authetication techniques are less socially accepted than entering a password
- Key management issues
  - Measurements of user's biology are used to construct a key, which is unique and corresponds to only a particular user
  - However, an attacker could obtain a user's biological measurements, and impersonate the user. E.g. wax imprint for copying fingerprints
  - Also, once the key (user fingerprint) is stolen, cannot revoke the user's key because the user cannot get a new fingerprint. Compared to passwords, where users can easily change their passwords if the password is compromised

Biometrics systems must protect the information for biometrics against abuse, and also prevent fake biometrics

# Final Notes

- Combining various authentication techniques is more effective than using a single authentication technique. E.g. biometric + password
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) is used to describe the case in which a user is authenticated based on 2 independent methods
  - E.g. ATM cards have a magnetic stripe for the user's name and account number (what you have) and then user must also enter a PIN (what you know)

Internet

- On the internet, computers are interacting with other computers, and each computer may have to authenticate themselves to each other, because all computers cannot be trusted equally
- Many protocols that can be used to allow computer-to-computer authentication, and these protocols will support 3 types of authentication: Client authentication, server authentication, and mutual authentication
  - Client authentication: Server verifies the client's identity
  - Server authentication: Client verifies the server's identity
  - Mutual authentication: Client and server verifies each other's identity
  - TLS/SSL used in HTTPS support client, server and mutual authentication over the internet
- Whether client/server/mutual authentication is done often depends upon the nature of the application and the expected threats
  - Many e-commerce websites provide server authentication once a user is ready to make a purchase because they do not want the client to submit a credit card number to a spoofed or impostor website
  - Spoofed websites are significant security threat because they do not cost much to setup

Cellphone

- On the other hand, in older cell phone networks, only client authentication was required
- Cell phone towers would only check that a phone (client) that attempted to communicate with it was owned by an authentic customer
- Phones did not authenticate the cellphone towerse, because cell phone towers were costly to setup, and required significant capital to spoof
- Cell phones were much cheaper, hence wireless carriers only required cell phones to be authenticated
- Today, the cost of cell phone base stations is significantly cheaper, and modern-day cell phone networks use mutual authentication

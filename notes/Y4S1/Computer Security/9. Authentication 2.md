# Authentication 2

Entity authentication: A process whereby one party (verifier) is assured of the identity of a second party (claimant) in a protocol

Objectives of authentication

1. Honest participant A (claimant) is able to successfully authenticate itself to B (verifier)
2. Transferability: B cannot reuse an identification exchange with A to impersonate A to a third party C
3. Impersonation: Probability that a third party C, distinct from A, playing the role of A, can cause B to accept A's identity is negligible

Basics of authentication

- What you know: Exhibiting knowledge fo secrets
- What you have: Magnetic/smart cards, hardware tokens etc, typically combined with passwords for 2FA
- Who you are: Physical characteristics (fingerprint, voice), behavioral characteristics (Signature, keystroke dynamics, etc)

# Authentication Protocol

Weak/Simple authentication

- Password based
- Unilateral: One entity (claimant) proves its identity to the verifier
- Prove knowledge of secret by giving up the secret

Strong authentication

- Involves mutual authentication, both parties take both the roles of claimant and verifier
- Challenge-response protocols: Sequence of steps to prove knowledge of shared secrets
- Prove knowledge of secret without giving up the secret

## Password-related Techniques

- Password storage: Plaintext (BAD), encrypted (FAIR), hashed (GOOD)
- Password policies: Rules imposed on the selection of passwords by users, number of failed attempts, etc
- Salting of passwords: Random data used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes a password. Used to safeguard passwords in storage. Salts defend against dictionary attacks due to the added random noise
- Alternative forms of passwords: Passphrases, OTP, visual passwords etc

One-way functions

- Password storage security relies on cryptographic construct called a one-way function
- A one-way function $f$ is a function that is easy to compute, but hard to reverse: $f(x)$ is easy, $f^{-1}(x)$ is not
- E.g. hash functions

Properties of hash functions

- Pre-image resistant: If given a hash value $y$, it is **computationally infeasible** to find $x$ such that $H(x) = y$
- Collision resistant: Computationally infeasible to find a pair $(x, y)$ such that $x \neq y$ and $H(x) = H(y)$

Important hash functions: SHA256, SHA512, KECCAK, ARGON2, bcrypt (for password hashing)

Password storage

- Plaintext
  - Claimant's password is checked against database of passwords
  - No protection against insiders or an attacker who gains access to the system
- Hashed/encrypted passowrds
  - Passwords are encrypted/hashed, and only the encrypted/hashed passwords are stored
  - Claimant's password is encrypted/hashed, and then compared against the database's version of the encrypted/hashed password
  - Some degree of protection against insiders/attackers

In OSes, password hashes are stored in a password file

- In windows, passwords are stored in Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file: `%windir%\system32\config\SAM`
- In Unix, passwords are stored in `/etc/passwd`, but in modern systems in `/etc/shadow`
- At the application level, passwords may be held temporarily in intermediate storage locations like buffers/caches/web page
- The management of these storage locations is normally beyond the control of the user: A password may be kept longer than the user has bargained for

Verifying passwords

- Claimant types in password $p$
- Password is hashed $h = H(p)$
- Password is checked against stored hashed password in database
- If hashes match, accept. Else, reject

## Attacks on Passwords

- Offline guessing attacks
  - Exhaustive attacks: Brute force
  - Intelligent attacks: Dictionary attacks
- Phishing/spoofing

Offline guessing attack

- An attack where the attacker obtains the hashed passwords, and guesses the passwords based on the hash
- Many incidents of stolen hashed passwords being obtained by attackers, as a consequence of hacks on the server, or sniffing traffic
- Usage of the same passwords across different accounts, so compromise of a password for one account affects other accounts

Brute force attacks

- Try to guess password by enumerating through all possible passwords and their hashes in sequence, checking whether they match the target hashes
- A measure against brute force attacks is to increase the space of possible passwords: Longer passwords, special symbols etc
- Password policy is important to increase difficulties of brute force attacks

Password Entropy: Measured by $2^k$

- The lower the number of bits, the easier it is to guess password
- $n$-bit security: Requires at least $2^n$ operations by an attacker to guess the password

Dictionary Attacks

- Choosing passwords with high entropy prevents brute-force attacks
- However, hashed passwords, especially for human-generated passwords, are still vulnerable to dictionary attacks
- Dictionary attacks exploits the weakness in human-generated passwords, which tend to derive from words in natural languages
- Users with the same password will have the same hash-value stored in password file
  - Guess some commonly used password
  - Compute hashed values
  - Look for same hash values in the password file

Pre-computed hash table

- A strategy for cracking hashed passwords is to pre-compute a hash table, containing pairs of passwords and their corresponding hashes
- If we have $k$ password candidates and each hash has $n$ bits, then we have a table of $k \times n$
- This may not be practical if $k$ is large
- Rainbow table
  - Not all hashes are stored, some are computed from the stored hashes
  - Not all hashes are represented
  - Tradeoff between space requirement and query time

Password salting

- To reduce the effectiveness of offline attacks using pre-computed hashes, a salt is added to a password, before applying the hash function
- Each salt is just a random string
- Each password has its own salt
- Salt value is stored along with the hash of password + salt
- For a salt of $n$-bits, the attacker needs to precompute $2^n$ hashes for the same password

## Password Storage

It is essential to store passwords in a way that prevents them from being obtained by an attacker, even if the application/database is compromised

- Majority of modern languages/frameworks provide built-in functionality to help store passwords safely
- After an attacker acquires stored password hashes, they are always able to brute force hashes offline
- As a defender, it is only possible to slow down offline attacks by selecting hash algorithms that are as resource intensive as possible

Hashing vs encryption

- Hashing and encryption both provide ways to keep sensitive data safe
- Passwords should be hashed, not encrypted
- Hashing is a one-way function (impossible to decrypt a hash and obtain the original plaintext value)
- Hashing is appropriate for password validation
- Even if an attacker obtains the hashed password, they cannot enter it into an application's password field and log in as the victim
- Encryption is a two-way function, the original plaintext password can be retrieved (if we have the key)

How attackers crack password hashes

- Not possible to decrypt password hashes to obtain original password, but possible to crack the hashes
  - Select password you think the victim has chosen
  - Calculate the hash and compare to hash of the victim
  - If hash matches, you have correctly guessed the plaintext value of the victim's password
- Process is repeated for large number of potential candidate passwords
- Different methods can be used to select candidate passwords
  - List of passwords obtained from other compromised sites
  - Brute force
  - Dictionary/wordlists of common passwords
- While the number of permutations can be enormous, high speed hardware such as GPU and cloud services with many servers for rent, the cost for an attacker to run these cracks is relatively small, to do successful password cracking, especially when best practices for hashing are not followed
- Strong passwords, stored with modern hashing algorithms and using hashing best practices should be effectively impossible for an attacker to crack
- It is your responsibility as an administrator to select a modern hashing algorithm

Salting:

- A salt is a uniquely randomly generated string added to each password as part of the hashing process
- As the salt is unique for every user, an attacker has to crack hashes one ata time, using the respective salt, rather than calculating a hash once, and comparing it against every stored hash
- This makes cracking large numbers of hashes significantly harder, as the time required grows exponentially
- Salting also protects against attackers pre-computing hashes using rainbow tables or database-based lookups
- Salting means that it is impossible to determine whether 2 users have the same password, without cracking the hashes, as the different salts result in different hashes even if the passwords are the same
- Modern hashing algorithms such as Argon2id, bcrypt, and PBKDF2 automatically salt passwords, so no additional steps are required when using them

## Password Hashing Algorithms

There are many modern hashing algorithms that have been specifically designed to securely store passwords. This measn that they should be slow (unlike crypto hashes such as SHA and KECCAK which were designed to be fast), and how slow they are can be configured by changing the work factor

- Argon2 (preferred)
- Bcrypt (if argon2 is unavailable)

## Password Security

Is security the highest if useres are forced to use long passwords, mixing upper/lower/special characters and numerical symbols, generated for them by the system, and changed repeatedly?

- Users may have difficulty memorising complex passwords
- Users may have difficulty dealing with frequent password changes
- Users may find ways of reusing their favourite passwords

1. Set a password
   - If there is no password for a user account, the attacker does not even have to guess
2. Change default password
   - Often passwords for system accounts have a default value
   - Default passwords help field engineers install the system. If left unchanged, easy for attacker to break in
3. Avoid guessable passwords
   - Prescribe a minimal password length
   - Password format: Mix upper/lower case, include numerical/special symbols
   - Today, online dictionaries for almost every langauge exists
4. Password ageing
   - Set expiry date for passwords, to force users to change passwords regularly
   - Prevent useres from reverting to an old password: Keep a list of recently used passwords
5. Limit login attempts
   - System can monitor unsuccessful logins, and react by locking the user account to prevent or discourage further attempts
6. Inform user
   - After successful login, display time of last login, and number of failed login attempts since, to warn user about recently attempted attacks

Alternative password forms

1. Passphrase: User enters a sentence or long phrase that is easy to remember, and the system applies a hash function to compute the fixed size actual password
2. Visual drawing patterns: E.g. android pattern screen lock
3. Picture passwords: Select objects in pictures/patterns. Used in windows 8
4. One-time passwords
   - OTP scheme attempts to address a key weakness of password-based schemes: Reuse of stolen passwords
   - Idea is to generate a list of passwords, and each password is used only once
   - Lamport's one time password scheme
   - Lamport's scheme uses a one-way function (e.g. cryptographic hash) to generate a sequence of passwords
   - In practice, most OTP systems used today are based of HOTP (An HMAC-Based One-time password algorithm, specified in IETF RFC 4226)

## Phishing/Spoofing

- Identification and authentication through username/password provide unilateral authentication
- Computer verifies the user's identity, but the user has no guarantee about the identity of the party that has received the password
- In phishing/spoofing, a party voluntarily sends the password over a channel, but is misled about the endpoint of the channel

Spoofing

1. Attacker starts a program that presents a fake login screen and leaves the computer
2. If the next user coming to this machine enters a username/password to the fake login screen, these values are captured by the program
3. Login is typically aborted with a fake error message, and the spoofing program terminates
4. Control returned to the OS, which now prompts the user with a genuine login request

Counter measures

- Display number of failed logins: May indicate tot he user that an attack has happened
- Trusted path: Guarantee that user communidates with the OS and not with a spoofing program: e.g. Windows has a secure attention key ctrl alt delete for invoking the OS system logon screen
- Mutual authentication: User authenticates to the system, system authenticates to the user

Phishing

- Attacker impersonates the system to trick a user into releasing the password to the attacker
- A message could claim to come from a service you are using, tell you about an upgrade of security procedures and ask you to enter your username/password at the new security site that will offer stronger protection
- Social engineering: Attacker impersonates the user to trick a system operator to release password to the attacker
- Must be careful to enter your passwords only at the correct site

Protecting password file

- Cryptographic protection
- Access control enforced by operating system
- Combination of cryptographic protection, and access control, possibly with further measures to slow down dictionary attacks
- OS maintains a file with usernames/passwords
- Attacker could try to compromise the confidentiality/integrity of the password file

Access control settings

1. Only privileged users can have write access to password file: Otherwise, an attacker could get access to the data of other users, simply by changing their passwords, even if it is protected cryptographically
2. If read access is restricted to privileged users, then passwords in theory could be stored unencrypted
3. If password file contains data required by unprivileged users, passwords must be encrypted, such a file can still be used in dictionary attacks
   - Thus modern linux/unix systems hide the actual password file in /etc/shadow, that is not accessible to non-privileged users

Failure rates: For authentication methods with "fuzzy" matching

1. Measure similarity between reference features and current features
2. User is accepted if match is above predefined threshold

New issue of

- False positive: Accept wrong user: Security problem
- False negative: Reject legitimate user: Creates embarrassment and inefficient work environment

Forged fingers

- Fingerprints may be unique, but they are not secret
- Attackers have shown how to lift fingerprints form iphone 5s. Similar attacks applied to samsung s5
- Rubber fingers have defeated many commercial fingerprint recognition systems in the past
  - Minor issue if authentication takes place in the presence of security personnel
  - When authenticating remote users, additional precautions have to be taken to counteract this type of fraud
- Secure storage of biometric data is important from the angle of personal privacy protection

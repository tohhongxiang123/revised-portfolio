# Imaging and Camera

# Imaging Concept

Optical system

-   Focus light rays from a scene point, and converge it to a point on a screen

Screen

-   Captures image using photoreceptors
-   Photoreceptors include: Receptor cells, camera films, CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) image sensor

Aperture

-   Controls the amount of light rays entering the device
-   How big the hole is

# Human Visual System

Optical system: Lens

-   Controlled by eye muscles when focusing

Screen: Retina

-   Receptor cells in the form of rods (black-white sensitive) and cones (color-sensitive)
-   Light from outside world is focused on to retina
-   Optic nerve sends light information to the brain's visual cortex

Aperture: Iris

-   Adjusts accordingly depending on how much light there is in the environment
-   If there is too much light, iris contracts to reduce the amount of light entering the eye

# Geometry in Image Formation

We want to know - where does a specific point in the scene appear on the screen?

## Lens

Using a lens

-   Bends light for imaging
-   Thin lens
    -   A lens with a thickness (distance along the optical axis between the two surfaces of the lens) that is negligible compared to the radii of curvature of the lens surfaces
    -   ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Lens1.svg/600px-Lens1.svg.png)
-   Paraxial rays
    -   A paraxial ray is a ray which makes a small angle to the optical axis of the system, and lies close to the axis throughout the system.
    -   ![](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fbc288fd1d6cec0ab2e4e62035da61a8)
    -   Roughly parallel, and close to the optical axis of the lens
-   Aberrations
    -   The deviation of light rays through lenses, causing images of objects to be blurred
    -   In an ideal system, every point on the object will focus to a point of zero size on the image. However each image point occupies a finite volume and has an asymmetrical shape

## Properties of Thin Lenses

![](https://phys.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/12325/figure-2026-06-07.jpeg?revision=1&size=bestfit&width=409&height=893)

-   All rays entering the lens parallel to the optical axis will intersect the focus on the opposite side (Basic property)
-   All rays entering the center of the lens will pass straight through and remain unchanged (Consequent property)
-   All rays entering the lens from the focal point will emerge parallel on the opposite side (Symmetry property)

## Fundamental Equations

An object plane maps to an ideal plane with the following relation:

$$

\frac{1}{O} + \frac{1}{I} = \frac{1}{f}
$$

-   $O$ is the distance of the object from the center of the lens
-   $I$ is the distance of the image from the center of the lens
-   $f$ is the focal length of the lens
    -   The focal length of the lens is the distance from center of the lens to the imaging point (the point where all the light is collected)

## Depth of Field (DOF)

![](https://photographylife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/DoF-sketch.jpg)

-   The distance between the nearest and furthest elements in a scene that appear to be "acceptably sharp" in an image.
-   Aperture affects DOF. Wide apertures give shallow DOF, while small apertures give deep DOF

# Photometry in Image Formation

The radiance at a point $P$ is given by:

$$
L(\bold{P}) = \rho \bold{I}^T \bold{n}
$$

-   $\rho$ is the albedo of the material
    -   Albedo is the fraction of sunlight that is diffusely reflected by a body
-   $\bold{I}$ is the source radiance vector (The vector from the light source to $\bold{P}$)
-   $\bold{n}$ is the normal vector to the surface at point $\bold{P}$
-   Units is watt per steradian per metre squared

## Simplified Model

-   Often we do not require the full physical model of image formation
-   We can use a simplified model $f(x, y) = i(x, y) \times r(x, y)$
    -   $f(x, y)$ is the image intensity at the point $(x, y)$
    -   $i(x, y)$ is the illumination function due to light sources at $(x, y)$
    -   $r(x, y)$ is the reflectance function due to object shape and albedo at point $(x, y)$

# Charged Coupled Device (CCD) Array

-   2D array of photo-diodes
-   Voltage at each diode is directly proportional to the image exposure
    -   Exposure = irradiance \* time
    -   Time is the interval that the shutter is open
    -   Irradiance is the amount of light energy that hits an object/point
-   Generate colors from voltage
    -   Bayer mask
        -   Bayer filter mosaic is a color filter array (CFA) for arranging RGB color filters on a square grid of photosensors
        -   ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Bayer_pattern_on_sensor.svg/2560px-Bayer_pattern_on_sensor.svg.png)
    -   3-CCD device for better quality
        -   A camera which uses 3 separate CCD device for each of the 3 colors (R, G, B)

## Spatial Sampling

-   Converts continuous to discrete
-   Smaller resolution results in higher pixel resolution
-   Each point is now a pixel

## Grey-Level Quantization

-   For digital representation, diode voltages quantized to more discrete levels
    -   More levels: Greater dynamic resolution
    -   8 bit: 256 grey levels from 0-255

## Image as a Function or Matrix

-   For grayscale images, we often express the image intensity at a particular pixel as a scalar function $(x, y)$
    -   Also can be viewed as a 2D matrix of (width, height)
-   For colored images, it is a vector of 3 functions $r(x, y), g(x, y), b(x, y)$
    -   Also can be viewed as a 3d matrix (width, height, 3)

## File Formats

-   GIF: 8-bit color indexing, lossless compression, usually used for web-art
-   TIFF: Traditionally used for scanned documents. May or may not be compressed
-   PNG: Newer lossless compressed format capable of handling 24-bit images (8-bit for each of R, G, B)
-   JPEG: Lossy compression format based on discrete cosine transform. Capable of achieving high compression ratios
-   JPEG2000: Latest lossy compression format based on Wavelet Transform

# Image Enhancement in Spatial Domain

# Why Image Enhancement?

-   Low contrast
-   Noisy
-   Blurred
-   Missing parts (image inpainting, not covered)

# How to Image Enhancement

Point processing

-   Each pixel's new gray level does not depend on another pixel's gray level

Spatial filtering

-   Each pixel's gray level depends on current gray levels of neighboring pixels

## Point Processing

Use a function

-   Original gray-level of pixel as input
-   New gray-level as output for the same pixel
-   $s = T(r)$
-   The same function is used for all pixels

Some functions may depend on global statistics

-   Maximum and minimum pixel gray-levels present in the image
-   Histogram of gray-levels

$$
g(x, y) = T(f(x, y))
$$

-   $f(x, y)$ is the original input image
-   $T$ is the intensity transformation
-   $g(x, y)$ is the output image

Examples of linear transformations:

-   $s = r$
-   $s = L - 1 - r$ ($L$ is the largest value in the image)

## Contrast Stretching

-   Increase contrast of images captured under poor illumination, due to wrong camera settings

## Power Law Transformations

A commonly used non-linear transform. Function expressed as $s = cr^\gamma$, where $c, \gamma$ are constants

## Histogram Equalization

-   We count how many pixels are in each gray-level
-   We plot the counts with a histogram
-   We group nearby gray-levels into a bin

Histogram equalisation attempts to flatten the gray-level histogram through a gray-level transformation

-   Bins can be combined, but cannot be split

Key Idea of where the $k^{th}$ bin goes

1. Ask where the $(k-1)^{th}$ bin now
2. Calculate how many new bins the $k^{th}$ bin needs, then move over to the last

# Spatial Filtering

Spatial filtering computes each pixel's new gray level based on the existing gray levels of the neighboring pixels

The filtering process is to move the filter point by point in the image function $f(x, y)$ so that the center of the filter is at $(x, y)$. At each point, the filter's response is calculated based on the specific content of the filter, and through a predefined "template" (or kernel)

We have a kernel $w$, which is a $2a + 1, 2b + 1$ matrix. We calculate the filter's response

$$
g(x, y) = \sum_{u=-a}^{a} \sum_{v=-b}^{b} f(u + x, v + y) w(u, v)
$$

## Correlation

Just use the above formula. For pixels at the corner of the image, we can either pad the image with the value of the pixel at the edge, or pad with 0

## Convolution

We usually rotate the kernel by 180 degrees before use

$$
h(u, v) = w(-u, -v) \\
w(u, v) = h(-u, -v)
$$

## Averaging Filter

Also known as the box filter

$$
\frac{1}{9} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

We can use different filter sizes

## Gaussian Filter

Gaussian smoothing filters have the shape of a 2D normal density function

$$
h(x, y) = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sigma^2} e^{-\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2 \sigma^2}}
$$

-   Compute at discrete values for different spatial filters, and normalize sum of filter coefficients to 1
-   Usually more reasonable and better than box filters: Give lower weights if it is further away

## Median Filter

Median filter is a nonlinear filter, and cannot be represented as a convolution

-   From the pixels within the kernel, take the median value
-   Useful for removing impulse noise (speckle/salt-and-pepper noise), effective in preserving edges
-   Difficult for theoretical analysis, but still widely used

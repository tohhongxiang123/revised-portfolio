# Image Edges

An image edge
- A sequence of connected edge elements, or edgels
- Properties: Gradient becomes large, curvature becomes small

# Edge Detection

Edge detection generally involves the following steps
- Edge filtering, take an input image and generate a grayscale image where pixels contain estimates of gradient magnitude
- Edge detection creates a binary image containing edgels from the edge filtered image
- Edge linking produces a set of  edges consisting of connected edgels

# Prewitt and Sobel

Prewitt gradient edge detector:

- However, unlike the Sobel, this operator does not place any emphasis on the pixels that are closer to the center of the mask.

Sobel gradient edge detector:

- The Sobel edge enhancement filter has the advantage of providing differentiating (which gives the edge response) and smoothing (which reduces noise) concurrently.
- The Sobel operator is more sensitive to the diagonal edge is than to the horizontal and vertical edges. On the contrary, Prewitt operator is more sensitive to horizontal and vertical edges

# Laplacian of Gaussian

The inverted gaussian

$$
h(r) = -\exp(-\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2\sigma^2})
$$

The laplacian of Gaussian

$$
\nabla^2 h(r) = - \left( \frac{x^2 + y^2 - 2\sigma^2}{\sigma^4} \exp(-\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2\sigma^2}) \right)
$$

Laplacian emphasizes curvature

- An edge gives double peak and detected from zero crossing
- Less sensitive to noise due to gaussian smoothing
- Able to selectively detect edges at different scales by changing $\sigma$

# Canny Edge

A commonly used advanced edge detector. The following steps are used
1. Gaussian edge filtering: To deal with noise
2. Non-maximal suppression: To deal with varying thickness
3. Hysteresis thresholding: To deal with varying strength

## Canny-1: Gaussian Edge Filtering

The input image $f(x, y)$ is filtered twice by the x and y derivates of Gaussian (DoG)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    h_x(x, y) &= \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} = - \frac{x}{\sigma^2} e^{-\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2 \sigma^2}} \\
    h_y(x, y) &= \frac{\partial h}{\partial y} = - \frac{y}{\sigma^2} e^{-\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2 \sigma^2}} \\ \\
    G_x &= f \ast h_x \\
    G_y &= f \ast h_y
\end{aligned}
$$

The gradient magnitude and direction

$$
\begin{aligned}
    M(x, y) &= \sqrt{G_x^2(x, y) + G_y^2(x, y)} \\
    \alpha(x, y) &= \arctan (G_y / G_x)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Canny-2: Non-maximal Suppression

To reduce broad filtered edges to single pixel-wide paths
- Pixels in gradient magnitude map are suppressed if they are not in local maxima
- Implement $M(x, y)$ by scanning along the gradient direction $\alpha(x, y)$ at each non-zero pixel, to determine if they are in local maxima

## Canny-3: Hysteresis Thresholding

Normal thresholding: $t$ is the threshold

$$
f_t = \begin{cases}
    1 & f \ge t \\
    0 & f < t
\end{cases}
$$

Hysteresis thresholding
- High threshold $t_H$ and low threshold $t_L$
- Condition: A pixel has neighboring pixels perpendicular to the edge gradient which have already been set to 1
- Useful for removing tiny noisy edges and finding long edges

$$
f_t = \begin{cases}
    1 & f \ge t_H \\
    0 & f < t_L \\
    1 & t_L \leq f < t_H \text{ and neighbor is an edge} \\
    0 & t_L \leq f < t_H \text{ and neighbor is not an edge}
\end{cases}
$$

# Edge Linking

- After normal or hysteresis thresholding, a binary image is obtained with strong connected edgels shown as 1's
- We often require edgel linking, which is not easy
  - Who and who should be linked

## Hough Transform: Line

The line equation is written as

$$
N \cdot [(x, y) - N] = 0
$$

Expanded as

$$
\rho(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) \cdot [(x, y) - \rho(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)] = 0
$$

Finally written as

$$
x \cos \theta + y \sin \theta = \rho
$$

It means that a pair $(\rho, \theta) \iff$ a unique line

## Hough Transform: Point

- Previous interpretation
  - Given $(\rho, \theta)$, there are many $(x, y)$ satisfying this equation, forming a line
  - A pair of $(\rho, \theta)$ means a line in the image space
- Another interesting interpretation
  - Given $(x, y)$, there are many points $(\rho, \theta)$ satisfying this equation. I.e. there are many lines $(x, y)$
  - A pair of $(x, y)$ means a sinusoidal curve in the Hough space

## Hough Transform: Generalisation

The Hough Transform is not limited to detecting straight lines
- It can be extended to any parameterised curve of the form

However, more complicated curves require
- More curve parameters
- Higher dimensional parameter space
- Polynomial increase in computational cost for generalised hough transform

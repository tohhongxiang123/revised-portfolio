# Color Perception and Processing

# Electromagnetic Radiation

-   Light is electromagnetic (EM) radiation
-   EM waves are different because of their wavelengths

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/EM_Spectrum_Properties_%28Amplitude_Corrected%2C_Bitmap%29.png)

-   Human eyes are only able to sense EM radiation in the 400-700 nm range
-   Red light has the longest wavelength of all visible light (700nm)
-   Violet light has the smallest wavelength of all visible light (400 nm)

# Spectral Power Distribution (SPD)

In normal circumstances, EM radiation contains EM waves at many different wavelengths

-   We can characterize the EM radiation using a spectral power distribution

    -   SPD is a plot of power (P) against wavelength (v)
    -   E.g. SPD of daylight, or SPD of reflected light from flowers

# Monochromatic Light

-   When light consists of EM waves at only a single wavelength, the SPD is a delta function, located at the wavelength. This is called monochromatic light
-   This occurs e.g. when light is refracted through a prism

# Human Photoreceptors

-   Visible light is not actually colored
    -   Color is simply a human visual perception
-   Humans have 3 types of photoreceptor cones on the retina, which are sensitive to different ranges of wavelengths
    -   Long, medium and short wavelength cones
-   Depending on which combinations of cones are stimulated, this causes the sensation of different colors

# SPD to Color

We can think of a color sensation as a simplified representation of the incoming light SPD

-   Human brain uses relative stimulation levels of all 3 types of cones to create the color sensation
-   Different SPDs can generate the same stimulation levels (i.e. create the same color sensation)

# Quantitative Color Specification

Useful to specify a color exactly

-   Qualitative names such as "pink" or "dark brown" are ambiguous
-   Possible quantitative measures
    -   Spectral Power Distribution
        -   Specifying the exact SPD of the light determines an exact color
        -   However, different SPDs can give rise to the same color: SPD contains much more information than is necessary
    -   Black body temperature
        -   A black-body radiator is a theoretical object that radiates an SPD which is a theoretical function of its temperature (red at lower temperatures, blue at higher temperatures)
        -   Incandescent lamps are approximate black-body radiators, and color is therefore sometimes specified by a temperature in kelvin (e.g. tungsten light is 3200K, camera flash is 5500K)
    -   Tristimulus values
        -   3 numbers specifying the proportion of 3 fixed primary SPDs

# Tristimulus Color Theory and Additive Color Mixing

Based on human visual experiments, it appears that a gamut (range) of colors can be reproduced by physically adding 3 primary SPDs in different amounts

-   Known as additive color mixing
-   Any SPD can act as a primary - not limited to red, green, blue
-   Different choices of the 3 primaries affects the gamut of colors

In 1931, the CIE (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage, or International Commission On Illumination) specified an initial standard set of primaries, consisting of monochromatic red, green and blue at specified wavelengths

-   Red: 700nm
-   Green: 546.1nm
-   Blue: 435.8 nm
-   They can be used to reproduce a large gamut of different colors (but not all colors)

In general, primary SPDs do not have to be monochromatic

## Tristimulus Values

Once we select and fix any 3 primary SPDs $P_1, P_2, P_3$, we can express a color in terms of 3 tristimulus values corresponding to the amount of the 3 primaries needed to create the color

$$
\begin{aligned}
    c &= (\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3) \\
    c &\leftarrow \omega_1 P_1 + \omega_2 P_2 + \omega_3 P_3
\end{aligned}
$$

Grassman's Law: Human perception of color mixing is linear. If we have 2 colors $c_a = (\omega_{1a}, \omega_{2a}, \omega_{3a})$ AND $c_b = (\omega_{1b}, \omega_{2b}, \omega_{3b})$, and $c_c = c_a + c_b$, then we can say that

$$
c_c = (\omega_{1a} + \omega_{1b}, \omega_{2a} + \omega_{2b}, \omega_{3a} + \omega_{3b})
$$

# RGB Color Base

![](https://public-images.interaction-design.org/literature/articles/materials/o6QBrjEXSi6iV4GsPq7H33cSUB8FVOdVW0e2Oj3p.jpg)

The RGB color base is useful for reproducing a large range of colors

-   RGB primaries are typically based on the SPD's of red, green and blue phosphors of normal CRT monitors
-   Unlike CIE RGB, phosphor RGB are not monochromatic primaries (phosphor contains light at a number of different wavelengths)
-   SPD of phosphor RGB can be obtained from the manufacturer

We can express a color as a 3D point in RGB color space

-   $(R, G, B)$, each $R, G, B$ either in $[0, 1]$ or $[0, 255]$
-   There is a limit to the maximum amount of R, G and B, hence we can visualize this RGB color space as an RGB color cube

# Luminance

Luminance is a quantity defining the brightness by which humans perceive differeent colors

-   For RGB color base, a common way of computing the luminance is

    $$
        Y = (R + G + B) / 3
    $$

-   However, human visual experiments show that a blue light is perceived as much more dark than a red light, and green light is the brightest (even if they all have the same radiance)
-   Based on experimental data, a more accurate computation for luminance for phosphor RGB is

    $$
        Y = 0.2125R + 0.7154G + 0.0721 B
    $$

# Chromaticity

Tristimulus values encode color in terms of 3 numbers. Each colors can have different levels of luminance

However, we want to compare color attributes that are independent of luminance

-   These attributes are called chromaticity
-   Colors with the same ratio of tristimulus values have the same chromaticity
    -   $c_a = (\omega_{1a}, \omega_{2a}, \omega_{3a})$ AND $c_b = (\omega_{1b}, \omega_{2b}, \omega_{3b})$ have the same chromaticity if $\omega_{1a}:\omega_{2a}:\omega_{3a} = \omega_{1b}:\omega_{2b}:\omega_{3b}$
-   Actual chromaticity coordinates are however defined differently for different color systems
    -   Since luminance is 1 variables, we expect that there are 2 chromaticity values

# CIE XYZ Color Base

Depsite the tristimulus color theory, no set of 3 physically real primary SPDs can reproduce all colors additively

-   This is simply a natural law of human vision
-   RGB color cube does not contain all colors that can be perceived by humans

The CIE also defined a set of XYZ primary SPDs

-   XYZ are physically impossible because part of the SPD has negative spectral power
-   However, XYZ can theoretically combine additively to reproduce all colors
-   XYZ color base is not useful for actual color reproduction, but very useful for color specification (Color specified as an $(X, Y, Z)$ triplet, where $X, Y, Z \geq 0$)

# CIE xy Chromaticity

The CIE defines $x$ and $y$ chromaticity coordinates via

$$
\begin{aligned}
    x &= \frac{X}{X + Y + Z} \\
    y &= \frac{Y}{X + Y + Z}
\end{aligned}
$$

Colors with the same ratio of tristimulus values have the same CIE $xy$ coordinates

# CIE xy Chromaticity Diagram

The CIE xy chromaticity diagram may be used to show how all different perceivable colors can be specified

-   The range of pure monochromatic colors are located on the top curve (along the curved perimeter)
-   The purple boundary below represent colors that cannot be created by monochromatic light, but are due to the mixing of extreme red and blue
-   The locus of monochromatic colors and the line of purples bound the range of human perceivable colors
-   We can compute the chromaticity coordinates for SPDs for normal RGB phosphors
-   Directly from Grassman's Law (linear mixing), we can see that the gamut of colors reproducible by RGB phosphors is bounded in a triangle ![](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248392467/figure/fig4/AS:668565178953735@1536409768435/CIE-1931-xy-chromaticity-diagram.png)
-   We can also see that no combination of 3 real primaries can cover the entire gamut of human perceivable colors
    -   Due to the shark fin shape, while 3 real primaries will give you only a triangle shape
    -   But RGB primaries can cover a wide gamut

# HSI Color Base

HSI color base is a commonly used system to specify a color via explicity attributes

-   Hue: How similar the color is to the different primaries
-   Saturation: How deep or "colorful" the color is (how far the color is from gray)
-   Intensity: Brightness of the color (Also known as Value, for HSV)

## Relation of HSI Color Base to RGB Color Cube

![](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361446602/figure/fig3/AS:11431281094100647@1667380332334/RGB-and-HSV-color-spaces-a-The-RGB-color-space-has-the-shape-of-a-cube-and-b-the.png)

Consider an RGB color cube

-   The intensity axis is aligned with the vector from RGB = $(0, 0, 0)$ to $(1, 1, 1)$ that coverse the full range of grays from black to white (Each gray has an RGB $(x, x, x)$)
-   The Intensity value of an RGB color is the component of the color vector projected onto the intesity axis, normalized between 0 and 1
    -   i.e. $I = (R + G + B) / 3$
-   A color in the RGB cube can also be projected onto a plane perpendicular to the intensity axis
-   Hue and saturation values are polar coordinates of the color on this plane
    -   Hue = angle of rotation about the intensity axis (0 - 360)
    -   Saturation: Radial distance of a point from the intensity axis on the chromaticity plane
        -   Larger distance = more saturated

HSI color base is often used for image editing

-   Hue, satuation and intensity are intuitive attributes that users want to manipulate independently
-   However, HSI is not perceptually accurate
    -   Inensity is computed as an average of R, G, B, which does not reflect accurate luminance

Color Enhancement via HSI Manipulation

-   We can manipulate each component of hue, saturation and intensity for all pixels simultaneously
-   Normally for image editing applicaitons
    -   Convert colors in RGB to HSI
    -   Manipulate HSi components, typically by
        -   Hue transformation involves adding a user-specified constant to the hues of all pixels (equivalent to rotating chromaticity plane about intensity axis)
        -   Saturation and intensity transformation involves scaling these values by a constant factor
    -   Convert colors in HSI representation back to RGB

# Paints and Inks

For paints and ink on a surface, primary SPDs are not added to create colors

-   Instead, paints and ink absorb (or subtract) various light frequencies from white light, reflecting only certain frequencies
    -   E.g. red paint only reflects light frequencies corresponding to red color sensation, and absorbs the rest
-   As with colored light, different combinations fo reflected light may result in the same color sensation

# Subtractive Color Mixing and CMY Color Base

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/CMYK_color_model.svg/180px-CMYK_color_model.svg.png)

In subtractive color mixing, we may also use the concept of primary colors

-   Primary subtractive colors may be encoded as spectrum of light frequencies that are absorbed
-   However, they are more commonly described by the chemical compounds in paint

The most common primary subtractive colors are Cyan, Magenta, Yello (CMY)

-   These colored inks are typically used in color inkjet printers

# RGB Color Histograms

Multicolored objects or image regions are often distringuished based on their distribution of different colors

We can encode this distribution in terms of an RGB color histogram

-   Unlike gray-level histograms which are a 1D array, RGB color histograms are represented with a 3D array
-   Can be visualised as a 3D RGB cube, with the number of counts in each histogram bin represented by the size of a small "ball" located in each bin position

# Color Based Classification

Color objects may be recognized or classified based on the similarity of their color histograms to reference histograms in an object database

Requires different methods for measuring histogram similarity which is not covered in this course

E.g.: Per pixel color-based classification for skin color classification, or whole/regional image histogram based classification for content-based image retrieval

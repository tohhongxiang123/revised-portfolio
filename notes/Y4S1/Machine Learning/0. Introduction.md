# Introduction

Machine Learning is a type of artificial intelligence that provides computers with the ability to learn from examples/experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Paradigms of Machine Learning

- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning
- Advanced paradigms
  - Semi-supervised learning
  - Active learning
  - Transfer learning

## Supervised Learning

- Examples are presented to computers as pairs of inputs and the corresponding outputs
- The goal is for the model to "learn" a mapping between inputs to labels
- For e.g., given a picture of a face, determine its gender
- Outputs can be discrete (categorical) or continuous
- Discrete value outputs are **classification** problems, continuous outputs are **regression** problems

## Unsupervised Learning

- Examples are presented to computers without any outputs
- The goal is for the model to "learn" an intrinsic pattern/structure of the examples
- For e.g., cluster similar looking faces together

## Reinforcement Learning

- Learning by interacting with the environment to achieve a specific goal
- The goal is to learn an optimal policy mapping **states** to **actions**
- For e.g., Deep-Q-Network is a model that learnt to play Atari 2600 games

## Limitations of Supervised Learning

- Requires sufficient labelled data to train a precise model (model with good prediction performance)
- Sufficiency of training data is context-aware, depends on different kinds of applications and specific datasets
- To solve the limitation of insufficient data, advanced paradigms are used

# Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

Supervised learning:

- Classification
- Regression
- Ensemble Learning

Unsupervised learning

- Clustering
- Density estimation
- Dimensionality reduction

# UTF-8

How does a computer store text and symbols?

-   Bits and bytes in binary (0s and 1s)
-   We have to find a way to encode symbols into bits

Encoding scheme: A way to represent symbols in binary

-   Unicode
-   Non-unicode

# Unicode

A computing industry standard for consistent encoding, representation and handling of text expressed in most world's writing systems

-   Each character is assigned a unique integer code (called code points), usually in hexadecimal
-   In the format `U+<hex_code>`
-   üê∂ U+1F436

## UTF-8

UTF stands for Unicode Transformation Format. 8 means we use 8-bit blocks to represent each character

-   UTF-8 is the most popular encoding scheme

# Text Processing

-   Text is stored in an array in binary
-   Computers do not know any boundaries regarding words/sentences
-   There are many different languages
    -   Some go left to right, others go right to left
    -   We mainly focus on English for NLP

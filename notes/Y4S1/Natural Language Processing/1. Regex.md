# Regex

Regular expressions (RE) are a language used to specify search text in a string
- Used in every computer language, word processor, and text processing tools
- An RE expression is an algebraic notation that represents a set of strings

REs are useful for searching through large corpus of text, and we want to look for a specific pattern
- An RE search function returns either the first match or all matches in the corpus
- The corpus can be a single document, or a collection of documents

# Basic RE Expressions

The simplest RE is just a sequence of characters
- To look for the word "test", we can use the regex `/test/`
- `/` is used to indicate that this expression is a RE
- Regular expressions are case sensitive

## Disjunction of Characters to Match

`[]` matches any single character within the class
- `/[wW]oodchuck/` matches both "woodchuck" and "Woodchuck"
- `/[1234567890]/`  (or more simply `/[0-9]/`) matches any single digit

## Negation

Square braces can also be used with a `^` to negate
- If `^` comes immediately after a `[`, the resulting pattern is negated
- `/[^a]/` matches any single character (including special characters) except an `a`

## Counters and Wildcards

- `?` matches 0 or 1 appearance of the preceding item. For e.g. `/deadlines?/` matches `deadline` and `deadlines`
- `*` matches 0 or more occurrences of the preceding item. For e.g. `/ba*/` matches `b`, `ba`, `baa`, `baaa`, etc.
- `+` matches 1 or more occurrences of the preceding item. For e.g. `/a+/` matches `a`, `aa`, `aaa`, etc.
- `.` matches any single character (except carriage return). For e.g., `/c.t/` matches `cat`, `cbt`, `c!t`, etc
  - `/.*/` matches any string of characters
  - Note that `/[^.]/` means "match anything except for the symbol "." instead
- We can use `{}` to denote a count
  - `/ba(na){2}` matches "ba" followed by 2 "na"s

## Anchors

Anchors are special characters that anchor regular expressions to particular places in a string
- `^` matches the start of the line. For e.g. `/^The/` matches only the word "The" at the start of a line
- `$` matches the end of the line. For e.g. `/man\./` matches only the word "man." at the end of a line (Note the `\` is used to escape the "." so that it literally looks for "." rather than any character)
- `\b` is used for word boundaries, and `\B` is used for non-word boundaries
  - `/\bthe\b/` matches the word "the" but not in the word "other"
  - `/\Bthe\B/` matches the "the" in "other", but not the word "the"

## Disjunction, Grouping and Precedence

`|` means "or"
- `/cat|dog/` matches either "cat" or "dog"

Parenthesis `()`
- Encloses a pattern and makes it act like a single character for the purposes of neighboring operators such as `*` and `^`
- For example, `/penn(y|ies)/` matches either "penny" or "pennies"
- `/(ab)+/` matches any string with at least 1 "ab" (ab, abab, ababab, ...)

Operators follow the following precedence rules
1. Parenthesis `()`
2. Counters `*`, `+`, `?`, `{}`
3. Sequences and anchors `^`, `$`
4. Disjunction

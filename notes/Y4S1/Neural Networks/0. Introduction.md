# Introduction

Artificial neural networks are inspired by biological neural networks in the brain

- Consists of densely interconnected set of nerve cells called neurons
- Human brain has nearly 10 trillion neurons, each connected to roughly 10000 other neurons
- Biological neurons operate in the milliseconds range, while a silicon chip operates in nanoseconds. However the brain compensates with a large number of interconnected neurons
- Human brain is extremely energy efficient ($10^{-16}$ joules per operation per second for the brain, but $10^{-6}$ joules per operation per second for a silicon chip)
- Brains have already evolved for millions of years, while computers only have been here for a few decades

# Information Processing in the Brain

- Brains use non-linear parallel information-processing system
- Information is distributed across the whole network
- Learning is a fundamental and essential characteristic of biological neural networks

# Components of Biological Neuron

- Soma: Cell body which processes incoming activation signals and converts input
  into output activations. The nucleus of soma contains the genetic material in the
  form of DNA. (The central processor)
- Axon: Transmission lines that send activation signals to other neurons (The wires)
- Dendrites: Receptive zones that receive activation signals from other neurons (Used to communicate with other neurons)
- Synapses: Allow weighted signal transmission between the dendrites and axons. Process of transmission is by diffusion of chemicals. (Also used to communicate with other neurons)

# Artificial Neural Networks

Artificial neural networks attempt to mimic biological neural networks in the brain. In the brain, neuronal signals flow along the axon in the form of electric pulses or action potentials

There are 2 types of ANN:

- Spiking neural network: Emulates action potentials between neurons in the brain
- Activation-based neural networks: Emulates the aggregate of action potentials

# Analogy Between Biological vs Artificial Neurons

| Biological | Artificial                |
| ---------- | ------------------------- |
| Soma       | Sum + Activation function |
| Dendrite   | Input                     |
| Axon       | Output                    |
| Synapse    | Weight                    |

# Feedforward Neural Networks

- 3 layer neural network (2 hidden layers + 1 output layer)
- Input layer consists of input nodes to receive input signals
- Layers between input and output nodes are called "hidden layers"
- If the depth (number of hidden layers) is large, feed forward neural networks are also known as deep neural networks
